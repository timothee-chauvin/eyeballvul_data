  "details": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's TUN/TAP functionality. This issue could allow a local user to bypass network filters and gain unauthorized access to some resources. The original patches fixing CVE-2023-1076 are incorrect or incomplete. The problem is that the following upstream commits - a096ccca6e50 (\"tun: tun_chr_open(): correctly initialize socket uid\"), - 66b2c338adce (\"tap: tap_open(): correctly initialize socket uid\"), pass \"inode->i_uid\" to sock_init_data_uid() as the last parameter and that turns out to not be accurate.",

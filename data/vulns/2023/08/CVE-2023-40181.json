  "details": "FreeRDP is a free implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), released under the Apache license. Affected versions are subject to an Integer-Underflow leading to Out-Of-Bound Read in the `zgfx_decompress_segment` function. In the context of `CopyMemory`, it's possible to read data beyond the transmitted packet range and likely cause a crash. This issue has been addressed in versions 2.11.0 and 3.0.0-beta3. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.",

  "details": "A heap out-of-bounds memory read flaw was found in the virtual nvme device in QEMU. The QEMU process does not validate an offset provided by the guest before computing a host heap pointer, which is used for copying data back to the guest. Arbitrary heap memory relative to an allocated buffer can be disclosed.",

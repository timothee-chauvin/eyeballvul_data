  "details": "FreshRSS is a self-hosted RSS feed aggregator. When using the greader API, the provided password is logged in clear in `users/_/log_api.txt` in the case where the authentication fails. The issues occurs in `authorizationToUser()` in `greader.php`. If there is an issue with the request or the credentials, `unauthorized()` or `badRequest()` is called. Both these functions are printing the return of `debugInfo()` in the logs.  `debugInfo()` will return the content of the request. By default, this will be saved in `users/_/log_api.txt` and if the const `COPY_LOG_TO_SYSLOG` is true, in syslogs as well. Exploiting this issue requires having access to logs produced by FreshRSS. Using the information from the logs, a malicious individual could get users' API keys (would be displayed if the users fills in a bad username) or passwords.",

  "details": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Netatalk. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the copyapplfile function. When parsing the len element, the process does not properly validate the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer.

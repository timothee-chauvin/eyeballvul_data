  "details": "vantage6 is a privacy preserving federated learning infrastructure for secure insight exchange. Assigning existing users to a different organizations is currently possible. It may lead to unintended access: if a user from organization A is accidentally assigned to organization B, they will retain their permissions and therefore might be able to access stuff they should not be allowed to access.

  "details": "A vulnerability was discovered in ImageMagick where a specially created SVG file loads itself and causes a segmentation fault. This flaw allows a remote attacker to pass a specially crafted SVG file that leads to a segmentation fault, generating many trash files in \"/tmp,\" resulting in a denial of service. When ImageMagick crashes, it generates a lot of trash files. These trash files can be large if the SVG file contains many render actions. In a denial of service attack, if a remote attacker uploads an SVG file of size t, ImageMagick generates files of size 103*t. If an attacker uploads a 100M SVG, the server will generate about 10G.",

  "details": "Discourse is an open-source discussion platform. Prior to version 3.0.1 of the `stable` branch and version 3.1.0.beta2 of the `beta` and `tests-passed` branches, a maliciously crafted URL can be included in a user's full name field to to carry out cross-site scripting attacks on sites with a disabled or overly permissive CSP (Content Security Policy). Discourse's default CSP prevents this vulnerability. The vulnerability is patched in version 3.0.1 of the `stable` branch and version 3.1.0.beta2 of the `beta` and `tests-passed` branches. As a workaround, enable and/or restore your site's CSP to the default one provided with Discourse.",

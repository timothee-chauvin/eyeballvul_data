  "details": "A NULL pointer dereference vulnerability was found in netlink_dump. This issue can occur when the Netlink socket receives the message(sendmsg) for the XFRM_MSG_GETSA, XFRM_MSG_GETPOLICY type message, and the DUMP flag is set and can cause a denial of service or possibly another unspecified impact. Due to the nature of the flaw, privilege escalation cannot be fully ruled out, although it is unlikely.",

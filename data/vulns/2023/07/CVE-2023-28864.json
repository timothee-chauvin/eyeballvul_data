  "details": "Progress Chef Infra Server before 15.7 allows a local attacker to exploit a /var/opt/opscode/local-mode-cache/backup world-readable temporary backup path to access sensitive information, resulting in the disclosure of all indexed node data, because OpenSearch credentials are exposed. (The data typically includes credentials for additional systems.) The attacker must wait for an admin to run the \"chef-server-ctl reconfigure\" command.",

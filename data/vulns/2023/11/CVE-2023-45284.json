  "details": "On Windows, The IsLocal function does not correctly detect reserved device names in some cases. Reserved names followed by spaces, such as \"COM1 \", and reserved names \"COM\" and \"LPT\" followed by superscript 1, 2, or 3, are incorrectly reported as local. With fix, IsLocal now correctly reports these names as non-local.",

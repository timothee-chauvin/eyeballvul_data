  "details": "Anyscale Ray 2.6.3 and 2.8.0 allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code via the job submission API. NOTE: the vendor's position is that this report is irrelevant because Ray, as stated in its documentation, is not intended for use outside of a strictly controlled network environment. (Also, within that environment, customers at version 2.52.0 and later can choose to use token authentication.)",

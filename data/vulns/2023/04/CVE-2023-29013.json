  "details": "Traefik (pronounced traffic) is a modern HTTP reverse proxy and load balancer for deploying microservices. There is a vulnerability in Go when parsing the HTTP headers, which impacts Traefik. HTTP header parsing could allocate substantially more memory than required to hold the parsed headers. This behavior could be exploited to cause a denial of service. This issue has been patched in versions 2.9.10 and 2.10.0-rc2.\n",

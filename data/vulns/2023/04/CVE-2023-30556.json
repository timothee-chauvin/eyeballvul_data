Affected versions are subject to SQL injection in the `optimize_sqltuningadvisor` method of `sql_optimize.py`. User input coming from the `db_name` parameter value in `sql_optimize.py` is passed to the `sqltuningadvisor` method in `oracle.py`for execution. To mitigate escape the variables accepted via user input when used in `sql_optimize.py`. Users may also use prepared statements when dealing with SQL as a mitigation for this issue.

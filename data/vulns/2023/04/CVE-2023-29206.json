  "details": "XWiki Commons are technical libraries common to several other top level XWiki projects. There was no check in the author of a JavaScript xobject or StyleSheet xobject added in a XWiki document, so until now it was possible for a user having only Edit Right to create such object and to craft a script allowing to perform some operations when executing by a user with appropriate rights. This has been patched in XWiki 14.9-rc-1 by only executing the script if the author of it has Script rights.",

  "details": "Laminas Diactoros provides PSR HTTP Message implementations. In versions 2.18.0 and prior, 2.19.0, 2.20.0, 2.21.0, 2.22.0, 2.23.0, 2.24.0, and 2.25.0, users who create HTTP requests or responses using laminas/laminas-diactoros, when providing a newline at the start or end of a header key or value, can cause an invalid message. This can lead to denial of service vectors or application errors. The problem has been patched in following versions 2.18.1, 2.19.1, 2.20.1, 2.21.1, 2.22.1, 2.23.1, 2.24.1, and 2.25.1. As a workaround, validate HTTP header keys and/or values, and if using user-supplied values, filter them to strip off leading or trailing newline characters before calling `withHeader()`.",

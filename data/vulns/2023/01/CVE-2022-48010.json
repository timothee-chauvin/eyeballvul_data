  "details": "LimeSurvey v5.4.15 was discovered to contain a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the component /index.php/surveyAdministration/rendersidemenulink?subaction=surveytexts. This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary web scripts or HTML via a crafted payload injected into the Description or Welcome-message text fields. NOTE: the vendor indicates that this is not a vulnerability because the manipulation requires Superadministrator privileges, and Superadministrators are already allowed to customize surveys with JavaScript as they wish.",

  "details": "Cacti is an open source operational monitoring and fault management framework. There are two instances of insecure deserialization in Cacti version 1.2.24. While a viable gadget chain exists in Cacti\u2019s vendor directory (phpseclib), the necessary gadgets are not included, making them inaccessible and the insecure deserializations not exploitable. Each instance of insecure deserialization is due to using the unserialize function without sanitizing the user input. Cacti has a \u201csafe\u201d deserialization that attempts to sanitize the content and check for specific values before calling unserialize, but it isn\u2019t used in these instances. The vulnerable code lies in graphs_new.php, specifically within the host_new_graphs_save function. This issue has been addressed in version 1.2.25. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.\n",

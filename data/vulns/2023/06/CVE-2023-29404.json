  "details": "The go command may execute arbitrary code at build time when using cgo. This may occur when running \"go get\" on a malicious module, or when running any other command which builds untrusted code. This is can by triggered by linker flags, specified via a \"#cgo LDFLAGS\" directive. The arguments for a number of flags which are non-optional are incorrectly considered optional, allowing disallowed flags to be smuggled through the LDFLAGS sanitization. This affects usage of both the gc and gccgo compilers.",

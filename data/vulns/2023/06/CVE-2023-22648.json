  "details": "A Improper Privilege Management vulnerability in SUSE Rancher causes permission changes in Azure AD not to be reflected to users \nwhile they are logged in the Rancher UI. This would cause the users to \nretain their previous permissions in Rancher, even if they change groups\n on Azure AD, for example, to a lower privileged group, or are removed \nfrom a group, thus retaining their access to Rancher instead of losing \nit.\nThis issue affects Rancher: from >= 2.6.7 before < 2.6.13, from >= 2.7.0 before < 2.7.4.",

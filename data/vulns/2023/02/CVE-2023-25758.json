  "details": "Onekey Touch devices through 4.0.0 and Onekey Mini devices through 2.10.0 allow man-in-the-middle attackers to obtain the seed phase. The man-in-the-middle access can only be obtained after disassembling a device (i.e., here, \"man-in-the-middle\" does not refer to the attacker's position on an IP network). NOTE: the vendor states that \"our hardware team has updated the security patch without anyone being affected.\"",

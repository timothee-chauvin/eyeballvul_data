  "details": "@fastify/multipart is a Fastify plugin to parse the multipart content-type. Prior to versions 7.4.1 and 6.0.1, @fastify/multipart may experience denial of service due to a number of situations in which an unlimited number of parts are accepted. This includes the multipart body parser accepting an unlimited number of file parts, the multipart body parser accepting an unlimited number of field parts, and the multipart body parser accepting an unlimited number of empty parts as field parts. This is fixed in v7.4.1 (for Fastify v4.x) and v6.0.1 (for Fastify v3.x). There are no known workarounds.",

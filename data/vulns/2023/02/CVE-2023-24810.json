  "details": "Misskey is an open source, decentralized social media platform. Due to insufficient validation of the redirect URL during `miauth` authentication in Misskey, arbitrary JavaScript can be executed when a user allows the link. All versions below 13.3.1 (including 12.x) are affected. This has been fixed in version 13.3.1. Users are advised to upgrade.

  "details": "Traefik is an open source HTTP reverse proxy and load balancer. When Traefik is configured to use the `HTTPChallenge` to generate and renew the Let's Encrypt TLS certificates, the delay authorized to solve the challenge (50 seconds) can be exploited by attackers to achieve a `slowloris attack`. This vulnerability has been patch in version 2.10.6 and 3.0.0-beta5. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should replace the `HTTPChallenge` with the `TLSChallenge` or the `DNSChallenge`.",

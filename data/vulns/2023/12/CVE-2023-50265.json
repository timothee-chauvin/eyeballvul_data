  "details": "Bazarr manages and downloads subtitles. Prior to 1.3.1, the /api/swaggerui/static endpoint in bazarr/app/ui.py does not validate the user-controlled filename variable and uses it in the send_file function, which leads to an arbitrary file read on the system. This issue is fixed in version 1.3.1.",

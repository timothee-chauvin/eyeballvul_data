  "details": "In the Streampark platform, when users log in to the system and use certain features, some pages provide a name-based fuzzy search, such as job names, role names, etc. The sql syntax :select * from table where jobName like '%jobName%'. However, the jobName field may receive illegal parameters, leading to SQL injection. This could potentially result in information leakage.\n\nMitigation:\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 2.1.2, which fixes the issue.\n\n",

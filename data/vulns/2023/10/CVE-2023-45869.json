  "details": "ILIAS 7.25 (2023-09-12) allows any authenticated user to execute arbitrary operating system commands remotely, when a highly privileged account accesses an XSS payload. The injected commands are executed via the exec() function in the execQuoted() method of the ilUtil class (/Services/Utilities/classes/class.ilUtil.php) This allows attackers to inject malicious commands into the system, potentially compromising the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of the ILIAS installation and the underlying operating system.",

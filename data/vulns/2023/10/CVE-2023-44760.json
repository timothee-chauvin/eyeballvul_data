  "details": "Multiple Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in Concrete CMS v.9.2.1 allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code via a crafted script to the Header and Footer Tracking Codes of the SEO & Statistics. NOTE: the vendor disputes this because these header/footer changes can only be made by an admin, and allowing an admin to place JavaScript there is an intentional customization feature. Also, the exploitation method claimed by \"sromanhu\" does not provide any access to a Concrete CMS session, because the Concrete CMS session cookie is configured as HttpOnly.",

  "details": "BigBlueButton is an open-source virtual classroom. BigBlueButton prior to versions 2.6.12 and 2.7.0-rc.1 is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF). This issue is a bypass of CVE-2023-33176. A patch in versions 2.6.12 and 2.7.0-rc.1 disabled follow redirect at `httpclient.execute` since the software no longer has to follow it when using `finalUrl`. There are no known workarounds. We recommend upgrading to a patched version of BigBlueButton.",

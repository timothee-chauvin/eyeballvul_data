  "details": "MiniZip in zlib through 1.3 has an integer overflow and resultant heap-based buffer overflow in zipOpenNewFileInZip4_64 via a long filename, comment, or extra field. NOTE: MiniZip is not a supported part of the zlib product. NOTE: pyminizip through 0.2.6 is also vulnerable because it bundles an affected zlib version, and exposes the applicable MiniZip code through its compress API.",

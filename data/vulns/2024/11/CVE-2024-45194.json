  "details": "In Zimbra Collaboration (ZCS) 9.0 and 10.0, a vulnerability in the Webmail Modern UI allows execution of stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) payloads. An attacker with administrative access to the Zimbra Administration Panel can inject malicious JavaScript code while configuring an email account. This injected code is stored on the server and executed in the context of the victim's browser when interacting with specific elements in the web interface. (The vulnerability can be mitigated by properly sanitizing input parameters to prevent the injection of malicious code.)",

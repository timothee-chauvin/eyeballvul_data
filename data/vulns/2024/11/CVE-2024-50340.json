  "details": "symfony/runtime is a module for the Symphony PHP framework which enables decoupling PHP applications from global state. When the `register_argv_argc` php directive is set to `on` , and users call any URL with a special crafted query string, they are able to change the environment or debug mode used by the kernel when handling the request. As of versions 5.4.46, 6.4.14, and 7.1.7 the `SymfonyRuntime` now ignores the `argv` values for non-SAPI PHP runtimes. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",

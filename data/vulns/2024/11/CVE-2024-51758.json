  "details": "Filament is a collection of full-stack components for accelerated Laravel development. All Filament features that interact with storage use the `default_filesystem_disk` config option. This allows the user to easily swap their storage driver to something production-ready like `s3` when deploying their app, without having to touch multiple configuration options and potentially forgetting about some. The default disk is set to `public` when you first install Filament, since this allows users to quickly get started developing with a functional disk that allows features such as file upload previews locally without the need to set up an S3 disk with temporary URL support. However, some features of Filament such as exports also rely on storage, and the files that are stored contain data that should often not be public. This is not an issue for the many deployed applications, since many use a secure default disk such as S3 in production. However, [CWE-1188](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1188.html) suggests that having the `public` disk as the default disk in Filament is a security vulnerability itself. As such, we have implemented a measure to protect users whereby if the `public` disk is set as the default disk, the exports feature will automatically swap it out for the `local` disk, if that exists. Users who set the default disk to `local` or `s3` already are not affected. If a user wants to continue to use the `public` disk for exports, they can by setting the export disk deliberately. This change has been included in the 3.2.123 release and all users who use the `public` disk are advised to upgrade.",

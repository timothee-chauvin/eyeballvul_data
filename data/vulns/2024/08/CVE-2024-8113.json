  "details": "Stored XSS in organizer and event settings of pretix up to 2024.7.0 allows malicious event organizers to inject HTML tags into e-mail previews on settings page. The default Content Security Policy of pretix prevents execution of attacker-provided scripts, making exploitation unlikely. However, combined with a CSP bypass (which is not currently known) the vulnerability could be used to impersonate other organizers or staff users.",

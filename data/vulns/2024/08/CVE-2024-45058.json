  "details": "i-Educar is free, fully online school management software that can be used by school secretaries, teachers, coordinators, and area managers. Prior to the 2.9 branch, an attacker with only minimal viewing privileges in the settings section is able to change their user type to Administrator (or another type with super-permissions) through a specifically crafted POST request to `/intranet/educar_usuario_cad.php`, modifying the `nivel_usuario_` parameter. The vulnerability occurs in the file located at `ieducar/intranet/educar_usuario_cad.php`, which does not check the user's current permission level before allowing changes. Commit c25910cdf11ab50e50162a49dd44bef544422b6e contains a patch for the issue.",

  "details": "mailcow: dockerized is an open source groupware/email suite based on docker. An unauthenticated attacker can inject a JavaScript payload into the API logs. This payload is executed whenever the API logs page is viewed, potentially allowing an attacker to run malicious scripts in the context of the user's browser. This could lead to unauthorized actions, data theft, or further exploitation of the affected system. This issue has been addressed in the `2024-07` release. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",

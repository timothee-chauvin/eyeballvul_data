  "details": "ntfs3 in the Linux kernel through 6.8.0 allows a physically proximate attacker to read kernel memory by mounting a filesystem (e.g., if a Linux distribution is configured to allow unprivileged mounts of removable media) and then leveraging local access to trigger an out-of-bounds read. A length value can be larger than the amount of memory allocated. NOTE: the supplier's perspective is that there is no vulnerability when an attack requires an attacker-modified filesystem image.",

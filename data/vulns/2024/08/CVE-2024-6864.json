  "details": "The WP Last Modified Info plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the \u2018template\u2019 attribute of the lmt-post-modified-info shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 1.9.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.",

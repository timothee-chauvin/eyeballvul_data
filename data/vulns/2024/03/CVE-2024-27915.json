  "details": "Sulu is a PHP content management system. Starting in verson 2.2.0 and prior to version 2.4.17 and 2.5.13, access to pages is granted regardless of role permissions for webspaces which have a security system configured and permission check enabled. Webspaces without do not have this issue. The problem is patched in versions 2.4.17 and 2.5.13. Some workarounds are available. One may apply the patch to `vendor/symfony/security-http/HttpUtils.php` manually or avoid installing `symfony/security-http` versions greater equal than `v5.4.30` or `v6.3.6`.",

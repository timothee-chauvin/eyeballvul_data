  "details": "Wasmi is an efficient and lightweight WebAssembly interpreter with a focus on constrained and embedded systems. In the WASMI Interpreter, an Out-of-bounds Buffer Write will arise if the host calls or resumes a Wasm function with more parameters than the default limit (128), as it will surpass the stack value. This doesn\u2019t affect calls from Wasm to Wasm, only from host to Wasm. This vulnerability was patched in version 0.31.1.\n",

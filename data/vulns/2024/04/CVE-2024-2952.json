  "details": "BerriAI/litellm is vulnerable to Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) via the `/completions` endpoint. The vulnerability arises from the `hf_chat_template` method processing the `chat_template` parameter from the `tokenizer_config.json` file through the Jinja template engine without proper sanitization. Attackers can exploit this by crafting malicious `tokenizer_config.json` files that execute arbitrary code on the server.",

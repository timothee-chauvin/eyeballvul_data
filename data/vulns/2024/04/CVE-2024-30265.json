  "details": "Collabora Online is a collaborative online office suite based on LibreOffice technology. Any deployment of voil\u00e0 dashboard allow local file inclusion. Any file on a filesystem that is readable by the user that runs the voil\u00e0 dashboard server can be downloaded by someone with network access to the server.

  "details": "The parisneo/lollms-webui repository is susceptible to a path traversal vulnerability due to inadequate validation of user-supplied file paths. This flaw allows an unauthenticated attacker to read, write, and in certain configurations execute arbitrary files on the server by exploiting various endpoints. The vulnerability can be exploited even when the service is bound to localhost, through cross-site requests facilitated by malicious HTML/JS pages.",

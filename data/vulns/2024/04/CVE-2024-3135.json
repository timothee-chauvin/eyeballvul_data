  "details": "A Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability exists in the mudler/localai application, allowing attackers to craft malicious webpages that, when visited by a victim, perform unauthorized actions on the victim's local LocalAI instance without their consent. This vulnerability enables attackers to exhaust system resources, consume credits, and fill disk space by making numerous resource-intensive API calls, such as generating images or uploading files. The vulnerability stems from the application's acceptance of simple request content-types without requiring CSRF tokens or implementing other CSRF mitigation measures. Successful exploitation does not require network access to the vulnerable LocalAI environment.",

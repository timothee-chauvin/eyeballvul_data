  "details": "XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform. Starting in version 5.0-rc-1 and prior to versions 14.10.20, 15.5.4, and 15.9-rc-1, any user with edit right on any page can execute any code on the server by adding an object of type `XWiki.SearchSuggestSourceClass` to their user profile or any other page. This compromises the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the whole XWiki installation. This vulnerability has been patched in XWiki 14.10.20, 15.5.4 and 15.10 RC1. As a workaround, manually apply the patch to the document `XWiki.SearchSuggestSourceSheet`.",

  "details": "A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists in the XMLFeedSpider class of the scrapy/scrapy project, specifically in the parsing of XML content. By crafting malicious XML content that exploits inefficient regular expression complexity used in the parsing process, an attacker can cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. This vulnerability allows for the system to hang and consume significant resources, potentially rendering services that utilize Scrapy for XML processing unresponsive.",

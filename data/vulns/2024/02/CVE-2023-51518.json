  "details": "Apache James prior to version 3.7.5 and 3.8.0 exposes a JMX endpoint on localhost subject to pre-authentication deserialisation of untrusted data.\nGiven a deserialisation gadjet, this could be leveraged as part of an exploit chain that could result in privilege escalation.\nNote that by default JMX endpoint is only bound locally.\n\nWe recommend users to:\n\u00a0- Upgrade to a non-vulnerable Apache James version\n\n\u00a0- Run Apache James isolated from other processes (docker - dedicated virtual machine)\n\u00a0- If possible turn off JMX\n\n",

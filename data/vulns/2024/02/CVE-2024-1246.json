  "details": "Concrete CMS in version 9 before 9.2.5 is vulnerable to reflected XSS via the Image URL Import Feature due to insufficient validation of administrator provided data. A rogue administrator could inject malicious code when importing images, leading to the execution of the malicious code on the website user\u2019s browser. The Concrete CMS Security team scored this 2 with CVSS v3 vector AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N. This does not affect Concrete versions prior to version 9.\n",

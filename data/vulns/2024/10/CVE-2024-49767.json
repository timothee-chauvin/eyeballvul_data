  "details": "Werkzeug is a Web Server Gateway Interface web application library. Applications using `werkzeug.formparser.MultiPartParser` corresponding to a version of Werkzeug prior to 3.0.6 to parse `multipart/form-data` requests (e.g. all flask applications) are vulnerable to a relatively simple but effective resource exhaustion (denial of service) attack. A specifically crafted form submission request can cause the parser to allocate and block 3 to 8 times the upload size in main memory. There is no upper limit; a single upload at 1 Gbit/s can exhaust 32 GB of RAM in less than 60 seconds. Werkzeug version 3.0.6 fixes this issue.",

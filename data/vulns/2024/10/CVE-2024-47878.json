  "details": "OpenRefine is a free, open source tool for working with messy data. Prior to version 3.8.3, the `/extension/gdata/authorized` endpoint includes the `state` GET parameter verbatim in a `<script>` tag in the output, so without escaping. An attacker could lead or redirect a user to a crafted URL containing JavaScript code, which would then cause that code to be executed in the victim's browser as if it was part of OpenRefine. Version 3.8.3 fixes this issue.",

  "details": "When editing objects in the Syncope Console, incomplete HTML tags could be used to bypass HTML sanitization. This made it possible to inject stored XSS payloads which would trigger for other users during ordinary usage of the application.\nXSS payloads could also be injected in Syncope Enduser when editing \u201cPersonal Information\u201d or \u201cUser Requests\u201d: such payloads would trigger for administrators in Syncope Console, thus enabling session hijacking.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 3.0.9, which fixes this issue.",

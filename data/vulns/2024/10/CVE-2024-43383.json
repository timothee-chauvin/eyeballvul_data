  "details": "Deserialization of Untrusted Data vulnerability in Apache Lucene.Net.Replicator.\n\nThis issue affects Apache Lucene.NET's Replicator library: from 4.8.0-beta00005 through 4.8.0-beta00016.\n\nAn attacker that can intercept traffic between a replication client and server, or control the target replication node URL, can provide a specially-crafted JSON response that is deserialized as an attacker-provided exception type. This can result in remote code execution or other potential unauthorized access.\n\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 4.8.0-beta00017, which fixes the issue.",

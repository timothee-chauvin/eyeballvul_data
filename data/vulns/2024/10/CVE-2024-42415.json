  "details": "An integer overflow vulnerability exists in the Compound Document Binary File format parser of v1.14.52 of the GNOME Project G Structured File Library (libgsf). A specially crafted file can result in an integer overflow that allows for a heap-based buffer overflow when processing the sector allocation table. This can lead to arbitrary code execution. An attacker can provide a malicious file to trigger this vulnerability.",

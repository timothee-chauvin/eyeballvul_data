  "details": "ClipBucket V5 provides open source video hosting with PHP. ClipBucket-v5 Version 2.0 to Version 5.5.1 Revision 199 are vulnerable to PHP Deserialization vulnerability. The vulnerability exists in upload/photo_upload.php  within the decode_key function. User inputs were supplied to this function without sanitization via collection GET parameter and photoIDS POST parameter respectively. The decode_key function invokes PHP unserialize function as defined in upload/includes/classes/photos.class.php. As a result, it is possible for an adversary to inject maliciously crafted PHP serialized object and utilize gadget chains to cause unexpected behaviors of the application. This vulnerability is fixed in 5.5.1 Revision 200.",

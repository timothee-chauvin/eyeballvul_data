  "details": "@marp-team/marp-core is the core for Marp, which is the ecosystem to write your presentation with plain Markdown. Marp Core from v3.0.2 to v3.9.0 and v4.0.0, are vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) due to improper neutralization of HTML sanitization. Marp Core v3.9.1 and v4.0.1 have been patched to fix that. If you are unable to update the package immediately, disable all HTML tags by setting html: false option in the Marp class constructor.",

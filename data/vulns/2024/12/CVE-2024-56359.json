A user visiting a malicious document and clicking on a link in a HyperLink cell using a control modifier (meaning for example Ctrl+click) could have their account compromised, since the link could use the javascript: scheme and be evaluated in the context of their current page. This issue has been patched in version 1.3.2. Users are advised to upgrade.

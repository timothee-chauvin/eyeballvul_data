  "details": "LinkAce is a self-hosted archive to collect links of your favorite websites. Prior to 1.15.6, a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the LinkAce. This issue occurs in the \"URL\" field of the \"Edit Link\" module, where user input is not properly sanitized or encoded before being reflected in the HTML response. This allows attackers to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the victim\u2019s browser, leading to potential session hijacking, data theft, and unauthorized actions. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.15.6.",

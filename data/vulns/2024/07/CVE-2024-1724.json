  "details": "In snapd versions prior to 2.62, when using AppArmor for enforcement of \nsandbox permissions, snapd failed to restrict writes to the $HOME/bin\npath. In Ubuntu, when this path exists, it is automatically added to\nthe users PATH. An attacker who could convince a user to install a\nmalicious snap which used the 'home' plug could use this vulnerability\nto install arbitrary scripts into the users PATH which may then be run\nby the user outside of the expected snap sandbox and hence allow them\nto escape confinement.",

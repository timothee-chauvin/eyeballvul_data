Certifi starting in 2021.05.30 and prior to 2024.07.4 recognized root certificates from `GLOBALTRUST`. Certifi 2024.07.04 removes root certificates from `GLOBALTRUST` from the root store. These are in the process of being removed from Mozilla's trust store. `GLOBALTRUST`'s root certificates are being removed pursuant to an investigation which identified \"long-running and unresolved compliance issues.\"",

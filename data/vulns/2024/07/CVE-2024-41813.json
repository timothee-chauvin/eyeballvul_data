  "details": "txtdot is an HTTP proxy that parses only text, links, and pictures from pages, removing ads and heavy scripts. Starting in version 1.4.0 and prior to version 1.6.1, a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in the `/proxy` route of txtdot allows remote attackers to use the server as a proxy to send HTTP GET requests to arbitrary targets and retrieve information in the internal network. Version 1.6.1 patches the issue.",

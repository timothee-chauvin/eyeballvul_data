  "details": "A vulnerability in significant-gravitas/autogpt version 0.5.1 allows an attacker to bypass the shell commands denylist settings. The issue arises when the denylist is configured to block specific commands, such as 'whoami' and '/bin/whoami'. An attacker can circumvent this restriction by executing commands with a modified path, such as '/bin/./whoami', which is not recognized by the denylist.",

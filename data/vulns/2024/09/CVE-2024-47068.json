  "details": "Rollup is a module bundler for JavaScript. Versions prior to 2.79.2, 3.29.5, and 4.22.4 are susceptible to a DOM Clobbering vulnerability when bundling scripts with properties from `import.meta` (e.g., `import.meta.url`) in `cjs`/`umd`/`iife` format. The DOM Clobbering gadget can lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) in web pages where scriptless attacker-controlled HTML elements (e.g., an `img` tag with an unsanitized `name` attribute) are present. Versions 2.79.2, 3.29.5, and 4.22.4  contain a patch for the vulnerability.",

  "details": "Concrete CMS versions 9.0.0 through 9.3.3 are affected by a\nstored XSS vulnerability in the \"Top Navigator Bar\" block.\nSince the \"Top Navigator Bar\" output was not sufficiently sanitized, a rogue administrator could add a malicious payload that could be executed when targeted users visited the home page.The Concrete CMS Security Team gave this vulnerability a CVSS v4 score of 4.6\nwith vector  CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:H/UI:A/VC:N/VI:L/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/4.0#CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:H/UI:A/VC:N/VI:L/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N . This\ndoes not affect versions below 9.0.0  since they do not have the Top\nNavigator Bar Block. Thanks, Chu Quoc Khanh for reporting.",

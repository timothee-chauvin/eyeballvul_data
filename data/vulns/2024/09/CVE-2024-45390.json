  "details": "@blakeembrey/template is a string template library. Prior to version 1.2.0, it is possible to inject and run code within the template if the attacker has access to write the template name. Version 1.2.0 contains a patch. As a workaround, don't pass untrusted input as the template display name, or don't use the display name feature.",

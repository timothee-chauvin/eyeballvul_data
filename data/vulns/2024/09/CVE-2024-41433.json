  "details": "PingCAP TiDB v8.1.0 was discovered to contain a buffer overflow via the component expression.ExplainExpressionList. This vulnerability allows attackers to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) via a crafted input. NOTE: PingCAP maintains that the actual reproduction of this issue did not cause the security impact of service interruption to other users. They argue that this is a complex query bug and not a DoS vulnerability.",

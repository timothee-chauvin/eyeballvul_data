  "details": "Xibo is an open source digital signage platform with a web content management system (CMS). Prior to version 4.1.0, a cross-site scripting vulnerability in Xibo CMS allows authorized users to execute JavaScript via the DataSet functionality. Users can design a DataSet with a HTML column which contains JavaScript, which is intended functionality. The JavaScript gets executed on the Data Entry page and in any Layouts which reference it. This behavior has been changed in 4.1.0 to show HTML/CSS/JS as code on the Data Entry page. There are no workarounds for this issue.",

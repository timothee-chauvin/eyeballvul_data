  "details": "When Bazel Plugin in intellij imports a project (either using \"import project\" or \"Auto import\") the dialog for trusting the project is not displayed.\u00a0This comes from the fact that both call the method ProjectBuilder.createProject\u00a0which then calls ProjectManager.getInstance().createProject. This method, as its name suggests is intended to create a new project, not to import an existing one.\u00a0\nWe recommend upgrading to version 2024.06.04.0.2 or beyond for the IntelliJ, CLion and Android Studio Bazel plugins.",

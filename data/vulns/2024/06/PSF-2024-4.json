  "details": "A defect was discovered in the Python \u201cssl\u201d module where there is a memory\nrace condition with the ssl.SSLContext methods \u201ccert_store_stats()\u201d and\n\u201cget_ca_certs()\u201d. The race condition can be triggered if the methods are\ncalled at the same time as certificates are loaded into the SSLContext,\nsuch as during the TLS handshake with a certificate directory configured.\nThis issue is fixed in CPython 3.10.14, 3.11.9, 3.12.3, and 3.13.0a5.",

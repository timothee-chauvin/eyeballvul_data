  "details": "A code injection vulnerability exists in the berriai/litellm application, version 1.34.6, due to the use of unvalidated input in the eval function within the secret management system. This vulnerability requires a valid Google KMS configuration file to be exploitable. Specifically, by setting the `UI_LOGO_PATH` variable to a remote server address in the `get_image` function, an attacker can write a malicious Google KMS configuration file to the `cached_logo.jpg` file. This file can then be used to execute arbitrary code by assigning malicious code to the `SAVE_CONFIG_TO_DB` environment variable, leading to full system control. The vulnerability is contingent upon the use of the Google KMS feature.",

  "details": "A path traversal vulnerability exists in the parisneo/lollms-webui, specifically within the 'copy_to_custom_personas' endpoint in the 'lollms_personalities_infos.py' file. This vulnerability allows attackers to read arbitrary files by manipulating the 'category' and 'name' parameters during the 'Copy to custom personas folder for editing' process. By inserting '../' sequences in these parameters, attackers can traverse the directory structure and access files outside of the intended directory. Successful exploitation results in unauthorized access to sensitive information.",

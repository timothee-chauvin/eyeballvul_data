  "details": "SFTPGo is a full-featured and highly configurable SFTP, HTTP/S, FTP/S and WebDAV server - S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob. SFTPGo WebAdmin and WebClient support password reset. This feature is disabled in the default configuration.\nIn SFTPGo versions prior to v2.6.1, if the feature is enabled, even users with access restrictions (e.g. expired) can reset their password and log in. Users are advised to upgrade to version 2.6.1. Users unable to upgrade may keep the password reset feature disabled or set a blank email address for users and admins with access restrictions so they cannot receive the email with the reset code and exploit the vulnerability.",

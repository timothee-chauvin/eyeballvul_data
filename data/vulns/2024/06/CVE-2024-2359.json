  "details": "A vulnerability in the parisneo/lollms-webui version 9.3 allows attackers to bypass intended access restrictions and execute arbitrary code. The issue arises from the application's handling of the `/execute_code` endpoint, which is intended to be blocked from external access by default. However, attackers can exploit the `/update_setting` endpoint, which lacks proper access control, to modify the `host` configuration at runtime. By changing the `host` setting to an attacker-controlled value, the restriction on the `/execute_code` endpoint can be bypassed, leading to remote code execution. This vulnerability is due to improper neutralization of special elements used in an OS command (`Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command`).",

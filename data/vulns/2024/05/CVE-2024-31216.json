  "details": "The source-controller is a Kubernetes operator, specialised in artifacts acquisition from external sources such as Git, OCI, Helm repositories and S3-compatible buckets. The source-controller implements the source.toolkit.fluxcd.io API and is a core component of the GitOps toolkit. Prior to version 1.2.5, when source-controller was configured to use an Azure SAS token when connecting to Azure Blob Storage, the token was logged along with the Azure URL when the controller encountered a connection error. An attacker with access to the source-controller logs could use the token to gain access to the Azure Blob Storage until the token expires. This vulnerability was fixed in source-controller v1.2.5. There is no workaround for this vulnerability except for using a different auth mechanism such as Azure Workload Identity.",

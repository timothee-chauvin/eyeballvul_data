  "details": "OpenAPI Generator allows generation of API client libraries (SDK generation), server stubs, documentation and configuration automatically given an OpenAPI Spec. Prior to version 7.6.0, attackers can exploit a path traversal vulnerability to read and delete files and folders from an arbitrary, writable directory as anyone can set the output folder when submitting the request via the `outputFolder` option. The issue was fixed in version 7.6.0 by removing the usage of the `outputFolder` option. No known workarounds are available.",

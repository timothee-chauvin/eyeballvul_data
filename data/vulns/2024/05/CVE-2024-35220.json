  "details": "@fastify/session is a session plugin for fastify. Requires the @fastify/cookie plugin. When restoring the cookie from the session store, the `expires` field is overriden if the `maxAge` field was set.\nThis means a cookie is never correctly detected as expired and thus expired sessions are not destroyed.

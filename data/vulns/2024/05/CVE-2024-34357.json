  "details": "TYPO3 is an enterprise content management system. Starting in version 9.0.0 and prior to versions 9.5.48 ELTS, 10.4.45 ELTS, 11.5.37 LTS, 12.4.15 LTS, and 13.1.1, failing to properly encode user-controlled values in file entities, the `ShowImageController` (`_eID tx_cms_showpic_`) is vulnerable to cross-site scripting. Exploiting this vulnerability requires a valid backend user account with access to file entities. TYPO3 versions 9.5.48 ELTS, 10.4.45 ELTS, 11.5.37 LTS, 12.4.15 LTS, 13.1.1 fix the problem described.",

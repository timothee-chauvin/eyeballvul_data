  "details": "A path traversal vulnerability exists in the parisneo/lollms-webui application, specifically within the `/list_personalities` endpoint. By manipulating the `category` parameter, an attacker can traverse the directory structure and list any directory on the system. This issue affects the latest version of the application. The vulnerability is due to improper handling of user-supplied input in the `list_personalities` function, where the `category` parameter can be controlled to specify arbitrary directories for listing. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to list all folders in the drive on the system, potentially leading to information disclosure.",

  "details": "A vulnerability in parisneo/lollms-webui versions up to 9.3 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code. The vulnerability stems from insufficient protection of the `/apply_settings` and `/execute_code` endpoints. Attackers can bypass protections by setting the host to localhost, enabling code execution, and disabling code validation through the `/apply_settings` endpoint. Subsequently, arbitrary commands can be executed remotely via the `/execute_code` endpoint, exploiting the delay in settings enforcement. This issue was addressed in version 9.5.",

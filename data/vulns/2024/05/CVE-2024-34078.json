  "details": "html-sanitizer is an allowlist-based HTML cleaner. If using `keep_typographic_whitespace=False` (which is the default), the sanitizer normalizes unicode to the NFKC form at the end. Some unicode characters normalize to chevrons; this allows specially crafted HTML to escape sanitization. The problem has been fixed in 2.4.2.\n",

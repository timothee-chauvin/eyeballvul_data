  "details": "SvelteKit is a web development kit. In SvelteKit 2, sending a GET request with a body eg `{}` to a built and previewed/hosted sveltekit app throws `Request with GET/HEAD method cannot have body.` and crashes the preview/hosting. After this happens, one must manually restart the app. `TRACE` requests will also cause the app to crash. Prerendered pages and SvelteKit 1 apps are not affected. `@sveltejs/adapter-node` versions 2.1.2, 3.0.3, and 4.0.1 and `@sveltejs/kit` version 2.4.3 contain a patch for this issue.",

  "details": "fastify-swagger-ui is a Fastify plugin for serving Swagger UI.  Prior to 2.1.0, the default configuration of `@fastify/swagger-ui` without `baseDir` set will lead to all files in the module's directory being exposed via http routes served by the module.  The vulnerability is fixed in v2.1.0. Setting the `baseDir` option can also work around this vulnerability.",

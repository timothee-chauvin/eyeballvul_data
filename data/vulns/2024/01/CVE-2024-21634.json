  "details": "Amazon Ion is a Java implementation of the Ion data notation. Prior to version 1.10.5, a potential denial-of-service issue exists in\u00a0`ion-java`\u00a0for applications that use\u00a0`ion-java`\u00a0to deserialize Ion text encoded data, or deserialize Ion text or binary encoded data into the\u00a0`IonValue`\u00a0model and then invoke certain\u00a0`IonValue`\u00a0methods on that in-memory representation. An actor could craft Ion data that, when loaded by the affected application and/or processed using the\u00a0`IonValue`\u00a0model, results in a\u00a0`StackOverflowError`\u00a0originating from the\u00a0`ion-java`\u00a0library. The patch is included in `ion-java` 1.10.5. As a workaround, do not load data which originated from an untrusted source or that could have been tampered with.",

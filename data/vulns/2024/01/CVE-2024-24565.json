  "details": "CrateDB is a distributed SQL database that makes it simple to store and analyze massive amounts of data in real-time. There is a COPY FROM function in the CrateDB database that is used to import file data into database tables. This function has a flaw, and authenticated attackers can use the COPY FROM function to import arbitrary file content into database tables, resulting in information leakage. This vulnerability is patched in 5.3.9, 5.4.8, 5.5.4, and 5.6.1.",

  "details": "Multiple integer overflows in Python 2.2.3 through 2.5.1, and 2.6, allow context-dependent attackers to have an unknown impact via a large integer value in the tabsize argument to the expandtabs method, as implemented by (1) the string_expandtabs function in Objects/stringobject.c and (2) the unicode_expandtabs function in Objects/unicodeobject.c.  NOTE: this vulnerability reportedly exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2008-2315.",

  "details": "Memory access out of buffer boundaries issues was discovered in Contiki-NG 4.4 through 4.5, in the SNMP BER encoder/decoder. The length of provided input/output buffers is insufficiently verified during the encoding and decoding of data. This may lead to out-of-bounds buffer read or write access in BER decoding and encoding functions.",

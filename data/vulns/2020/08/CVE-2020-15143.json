  "details": "In SyliusResourceBundle before versions 1.3.14, 1.4.7, 1.5.2 and 1.6.4, rrequest parameters injected inside an expression evaluated by `symfony/expression-language` package haven't been sanitized properly. This allows the attacker to access any public service by manipulating that request parameter, allowing for Remote Code Execution. This issue has been patched for versions 1.3.14, 1.4.7, 1.5.2 and 1.6.4. Versions prior to 1.3 were not patched.",

  "details": "An integer overflow in the getnum function in lua_struct.c in Redis before 6.0.3 allows context-dependent attackers with permission to run Lua code in a Redis session to cause a denial of service (memory corruption and application crash) or possibly bypass intended sandbox restrictions via a large number, which triggers a stack-based buffer overflow. NOTE: this issue exists because of a CVE-2015-8080 regression.",

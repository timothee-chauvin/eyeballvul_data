  "details": "A buffer overflow vulnerability has been found in the baremetal component of Apache CloudStack. This applies to all versions prior to 4.13.1. The vulnerability is due to the lack of validation of the mac parameter in baremetal virtual router. If you insert an arbitrary shell command into the mac parameter, v-router will process the command. For example: Normal: http://{GW}:10086/baremetal/provisiondone/{mac}, Abnormal: http://{GW}:10086/baremetal/provisiondone/#';whoami;#. Mitigation of this issue is an upgrade to Apache CloudStack 4.13.1.0 or beyond.",

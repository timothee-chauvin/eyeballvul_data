  "details": "A deserialization flaw is present in Taoensso Nippy before 2.14.2. In some circumstances, it is possible for an attacker to create a malicious payload that, when deserialized, will allow arbitrary code to be executed. This occurs because there is automatic use of the Java Serializable interface.",

  "details": "An issue was discovered in the _send_secure_msg() function of yubihsm-shell through 2.0.2. The function does not validate the embedded length field of a message received from the device. This could lead to an oversized memcpy() call that will crash the running process. This could be used by an attacker to cause a denial of service.",

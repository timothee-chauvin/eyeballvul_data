  "details": "Red Discord Bot Dashboard is an easy-to-use interactive web dashboard to control your Redbot. In Red Discord Bot before version 0.1.7a an RCE exploit has been discovered. This exploit allows Discord users with specially crafted Server names and Usernames/Nicknames to inject code into the webserver front-end code. By abusing this exploit, it's possible to perform destructive actions and/or access sensitive information. This high severity exploit has been fixed on version 0.1.7a. There are no workarounds, bot owners must upgrade their relevant packages (Dashboard module and Dashboard webserver) in order to patch this issue.",

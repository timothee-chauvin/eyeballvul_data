  "details": "jupyterhub-systemdspawner enables JupyterHub to spawn single-user notebook servers using systemd. In jupyterhub-systemdspawner before version 0.15 user API tokens issued to single-user servers are specified in the environment of systemd units. These tokens are incorrectly accessible to all users. In particular, the-littlest-jupyterhub is affected, which uses systemdspawner by default. This is patched in jupyterhub-systemdspawner v0.15",

  "details": "Fleet is an open source osquery manager. In Fleet before version 3.5.1, due to issues in Go's standard library XML parsing, a valid SAML response may be mutated by an attacker to modify the trusted document. This can result in allowing unverified logins from a SAML IdP. Users that configure Fleet with SSO login may be vulnerable to this issue. This issue is patched in 3.5.1. The fix was made using https://github.com/mattermost/xml-roundtrip-validator If upgrade to 3.5.1 is not possible, users should disable SSO authentication in Fleet.",

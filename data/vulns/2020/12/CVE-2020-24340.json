  "details": "An issue was discovered in picoTCP and picoTCP-NG through 1.7.0. The code that processes DNS responses in pico_mdns_handle_data_as_answers_generic() in pico_mdns.c does not check whether the number of answers/responses specified in a DNS packet header corresponds to the response data available in the packet, leading to an out-of-bounds read, invalid pointer dereference, and Denial-of-Service.",

  "details": "In symfony/security-http before versions 4.4.7 and 5.0.7, when a `Firewall` checks access control rule, it iterate overs each rule's attributes and stops as soon as the accessDecisionManager decides to grant access on the attribute, preventing the check of next attributes that should have been take into account in an unanimous strategy. The accessDecisionManager is now called with all attributes at once, allowing the unanimous strategy being applied on each attribute. This issue is patched in versions 4.4.7 and 5.0.7.",

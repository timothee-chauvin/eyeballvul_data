  "details": "An improper file permissions vulnerability affects Kata Containers prior to 1.11.5. When using a Kubernetes hostPath volume and mounting either a file or directory into a container as readonly, the file/directory is mounted as readOnly inside the container, but is still writable inside the guest. For a container breakout situation, a malicious guest can potentially modify or delete files/directories expected to be read-only.",

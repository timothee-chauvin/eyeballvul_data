  "details": "An issue was discovered in RIPE NCC RPKI Validator 3.x through 3.1-2020.07.06.14.28. It allows remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions or to cause a denial of service on dependent routing systems by strategically withholding RPKI Route Origin Authorisation \".roa\" files or X509 Certificate Revocation List files from the RPKI relying party's view. NOTE: some third parties may regard this as a preferred behavior, not a vulnerability",

  "details": "A security regression of CVE-2019-9636 was discovered in python since commit d537ab0ff9767ef024f26246899728f0116b1ec3 affecting versions 2.7, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7 and from v3.8.0a4 through v3.8.0b1, which still allows an attacker to exploit CVE-2019-9636 by abusing the user and password parts of a URL. When an application parses user-supplied URLs to store cookies, authentication credentials, or other kind of information, it is possible for an attacker to provide specially crafted URLs to make the application locate host-related information (e.g. cookies, authentication data) and send them to a different host than where it should, unlike if the URLs had been correctly parsed. The result of an attack may vary based on the application.",

Due to incorrect input validation, there is a heap-based buffer overflow that can result in Denial of Service to all clients using the proxy. Severity is high due to this vulnerability occurring before normal security checks; any remote client that can reach the proxy port can trivially perform the attack via a crafted URI scheme.",

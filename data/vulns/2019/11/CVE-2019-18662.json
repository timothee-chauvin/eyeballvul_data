  "details": "An issue was discovered in YouPHPTube through 7.7. User input passed through the live_stream_code POST parameter to /plugin/LiveChat/getChat.json.php is not properly sanitized (in getFromChat in plugin/LiveChat/Objects/LiveChatObj.php) before being used to construct a SQL query. This can be exploited by malicious users to, e.g., read sensitive data from the database through in-band SQL Injection attacks. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires the Live Chat plugin to be enabled.",

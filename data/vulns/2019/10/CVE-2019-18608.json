  "details": "Cezerin v0.33.0 allows unauthorized order-information modification because certain internal attributes can be overwritten via a conflicting name when processing order requests. Hence, a malicious customer can manipulate an order (e.g., its payment status or shipping fee) by adding additional attributes to user-input during the PUT /ajax/cart operation for a checkout, because of getValidDocumentForUpdate in api/server/services/orders/orders.js.",

  "details": "In ZeroMQ libzmq before 4.0.9, 4.1.x before 4.1.7, and 4.2.x before 4.3.2, a remote, unauthenticated client connecting to a libzmq application, running with a socket listening with CURVE encryption/authentication enabled, may cause a stack overflow and overwrite the stack with arbitrary data, due to a buffer overflow in the library. Users running public servers with the above configuration are highly encouraged to upgrade as soon as possible, as there are no known mitigations.",

  "details": "In Cloud Foundry Foundation CAPI-release versions after v1.6.0 and prior to v1.38.0 and cf-release versions after v244 and prior to v270, there is an incomplete fix for CVE-2017-8035. If you took steps to remediate CVE-2017-8035 you should also upgrade to fix this CVE. A carefully crafted CAPI request from a Space Developer can allow them to gain access to files on the Cloud Controller VM for that installation, aka an Information Leak / Disclosure.",

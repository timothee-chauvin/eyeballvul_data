  "details": "It was found that under some situations and configurations of Apache Storm 1.x before 1.0.4 and 1.1.x before 1.1.1, it is theoretically possible for the owner of a topology to trick the supervisor to launch a worker as a different, non-root, user. In the worst case this could lead to secure credentials of the other user being compromised.",

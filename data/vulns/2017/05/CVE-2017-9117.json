  "details": "In LibTIFF 4.0.6 and possibly other versions, the program processes BMP images without verifying that biWidth and biHeight in the bitmap-information header match the actual input, as demonstrated by a heap-based buffer over-read in bmp2tiff. NOTE: mentioning bmp2tiff does not imply that the activation point is in the bmp2tiff.c file (which was removed before the 4.0.7 release).",

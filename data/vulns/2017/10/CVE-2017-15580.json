  "details": "osTicket 1.10.1 provides a functionality to upload 'html' files with associated formats. However, it does not properly validate the uploaded file's contents and thus accepts any type of file, such as with a tickets.php request that is modified with a .html extension changed to a .exe extension. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to upload arbitrary files on the web application having malicious content.",

  "details": "Misskey is an open source, decentralized microblogging platform. In affected versions a Server-Side Request Forgery vulnerability exists in \"Upload from URL\" and remote attachment handling. This could result in the disclosure of non-public information within the internal network. This has been fixed in 12.90.0. However, if you are using a proxy, you will need to take additional measures. As a workaround this exploit may be avoided by appropriately restricting access to private networks from the host where the application is running.",

  "details": "Smashing 1.3.4 is vulnerable to Cross Site Scripting (XSS). A URL for a widget can be crafted and used to execute JavaScript on the victim's computer. The JavaScript code can then steal data available in the session/cookies depending on the user environment (e.g. if re-using internal URL's for deploying, or cookies that are very permissive) private information may be retrieved by the attacker.",

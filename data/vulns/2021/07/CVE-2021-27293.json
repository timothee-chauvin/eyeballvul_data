  "details": "RestSharp < 106.11.8-alpha.0.13 uses a regular expression which is vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) when converting strings into DateTimes. If a server responds with a malicious string, the client using RestSharp will be stuck processing it for an exceedingly long time. Thus the remote server can trigger Denial of Service.",

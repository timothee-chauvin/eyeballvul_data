  "details": "Emissary is a P2P-based, data-driven workflow engine. Emissary version 6.4.0 is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF). In particular, the `RegisterPeerAction` endpoint and the `AddChildDirectoryAction` endpoint are vulnerable to SSRF. This vulnerability may lead to credential leaks.

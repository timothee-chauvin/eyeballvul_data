  "details": "An issue was discovered in the AbuseFilter extension in MediaWiki through 1.36. If the MediaWiki:Abusefilter-blocker message is invalid within the content language, the filter user falls back to the English version, but that English version could also be invalid on a wiki. This would result in a fatal error, and potentially fail to block or restrict a potentially nefarious user.",

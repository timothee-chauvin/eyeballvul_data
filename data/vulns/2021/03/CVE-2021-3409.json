  "details": "The patch for CVE-2020-17380/CVE-2020-25085 was found to be ineffective, thus making QEMU vulnerable to the out-of-bounds read/write access issues previously found in the SDHCI controller emulation code. This flaw allows a malicious privileged guest to crash the QEMU process on the host, resulting in a denial of service or potential code execution. QEMU up to (including) 5.2.0 is affected by this.",

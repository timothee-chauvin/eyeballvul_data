  "details": "In SPIRE 0.8.1 through 0.8.4 and before versions 0.9.4, 0.10.2, 0.11.3 and 0.12.1, specially crafted requests to the FetchX509SVID RPC of SPIRE Server\u2019s Legacy Node API can result in the possible issuance of an X.509 certificate with a URI SAN for a SPIFFE ID that the agent is not authorized to distribute. Proper controls are in place to require that the caller presents a valid agent certificate that is already authorized to issue at least one SPIFFE ID, and the requested SPIFFE ID belongs to the same trust domain, prior to being able to trigger this vulnerability. This issue has been fixed in SPIRE versions 0.8.5, 0.9.4, 0.10.2, 0.11.3 and 0.12.1.",

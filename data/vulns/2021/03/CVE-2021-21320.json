  "details": "matrix-react-sdk is an npm package which is a Matrix SDK for React Javascript. In matrix-react-sdk before version 3.15.0, the user content sandbox can be abused to trick users into opening unexpected documents. The content is opened with a `blob` origin that cannot access Matrix user data, so messages and secrets are not at risk. This has been fixed in version 3.15.0.",

  "details": "Symfony/Http-Kernel is the HTTP kernel component for Symfony, a PHP framework for web and console applications and a set of reusable PHP components. Headers that are not part of the \"trusted_headers\" allowed list are ignored and protect users from \"Cache poisoning\" attacks. In Symfony 5.2, maintainers added support for the `X-Forwarded-Prefix` headers, but this header was accessible in SubRequest, even if it was not part of the \"trusted_headers\" allowed list. An attacker could leverage this opportunity to forge requests containing a `X-Forwarded-Prefix` header, leading to a web cache poisoning issue. Versions 5.3.12 and later have a patch to ensure that the `X-Forwarded-Prefix` header is not forwarded to subrequests when it is not trusted.",

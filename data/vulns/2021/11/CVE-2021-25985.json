  "details": "In Factor (App Framework & Headless CMS) v1.0.4 to v1.8.30, improperly invalidate a user\u2019s session even after the user logs out of the application. In addition, user sessions are stored in the browser\u2019s local storage, which by default does not have an expiration time. This makes it possible for an attacker to steal and reuse the cookies using techniques such as XSS attacks, followed by a local account takeover.",

  "details": "The npm package \"striptags\" is an implementation of PHP's strip_tags in Typescript. In striptags before version 3.2.0, a type-confusion vulnerability can cause `striptags` to concatenate unsanitized strings when an array-like object is passed in as the `html` parameter. This can be abused by an attacker who can control the shape of their input, e.g. if query parameters are passed directly into the function. This can lead to a XSS.",

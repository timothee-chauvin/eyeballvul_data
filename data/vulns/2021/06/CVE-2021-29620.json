  "details": "Report portal is an open source reporting and analysis framework. Starting from version 3.1.0 of the service-api XML parsing was introduced. Unfortunately the XML parser was not configured properly to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks. This allows a user to import a specifically-crafted XML file which imports external Document Type Definition (DTD) file with external entities for extraction of secrets from Report Portal service-api module or server-side request forgery. This will be resolved in the 5.4.0 release.",

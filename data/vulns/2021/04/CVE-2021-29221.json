  "details": "A local privilege escalation vulnerability was discovered in Erlang/OTP prior to version 23.2.3. By adding files to an existing installation's directory, a local attacker could hijack accounts of other users running Erlang programs or possibly coerce a service running with \"erlsrv.exe\" to execute arbitrary code as Local System. This can occur only under specific conditions on Windows with unsafe filesystem permissions.",

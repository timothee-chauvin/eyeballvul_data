  "details": "OneDev is an all-in-one devops platform. In OneDev before version 4.0.3, the application's BasePage registers an AJAX event listener (`AbstractPostAjaxBehavior`) in all pages other than the login page. This listener decodes and deserializes the `data` query parameter. We can access this listener by submitting a POST request to any page. This issue may lead to `post-auth RCE` This endpoint is subject to authentication and, therefore, requires a valid user to carry on the attack. This issue was addressed in 4.0.3 by encrypting serialization payload with secrets only known to server.",

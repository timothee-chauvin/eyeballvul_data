  "details": "React Router is a router for React. In versions 6.0.0 through 6.30.1 and 7.0.0 through 7.9.5, an attacker-supplied path can be crafted so that when a React Router application navigates to it via navigate(), <Link>, or redirect(), the app performs a navigation/redirect to an external URL. This is only an issue if you are passing untrusted content into navigation paths in your application code. This issue has been patched in versions 6.30.2 and 7.9.6.",

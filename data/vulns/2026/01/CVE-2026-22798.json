  "details": "hermes is an implementation of the HERMES workflow to automatize software publication with rich metadata. From 0.8.1 to before 0.9.1, hermes subcommands take arbitrary options under the -O argument. These have been logged in raw form. If users provide sensitive data such as API tokens (e.g., via hermes deposit -O invenio_rdm.auth_token SECRET), these are written to the log file in plain text, making them available to whoever can access the log file. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.9.1.",
  "summary": "hermes's raw options logging may disclose secrets passed in via subcommand options argument",

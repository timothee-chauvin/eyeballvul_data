  "details": "When doing TLS related transfers with reused easy or multi handles and\naltering the  `CURLSSLOPT_NO_PARTIALCHAIN` option, libcurl could accidentally\nreuse a CA store cached in memory for which the partial chain option was\nreversed. Contrary to the user's wishes and expectations. This could make\nlibcurl find and accept a trust chain that it otherwise would not.",

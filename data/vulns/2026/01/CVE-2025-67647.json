  "details": "SvelteKit is a framework for rapidly developing robust, performant web applications using Svelte. Prior to 2.49.5, SvelteKit is vulnerable to a server side request forgery (SSRF) and denial of service (DoS) under certain conditions. From 2.44.0 through 2.49.4, the vulnerability results in a DoS when your app has at least one prerendered route (export const prerender = true). From 2.19.0 through 2.49.4, the vulnerability results in a DoS when your app has at least one prerendered route and you are using adapter-node without a configured ORIGIN environment variable, and you are not using a reverse proxy that implements Host header validation. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.49.5.",

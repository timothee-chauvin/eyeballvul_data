  "details": "MyTube is a self-hosted downloader and player for several video websites. Versions 1.7.78 and below have a Mass Assignment vulnerability in the settings management functionality due to insufficient input validation. The application's saveSettings() function accepts arbitrary key-value pairs without validating property names against allowed settings. The function uses Record<string, any> as input type and iterates over all entries using Object.entries() without filtering unauthorized properties. Any field sent by the attacker is directly persisted to the database, regardless of whether it corresponds to a legitimate application setting. This issue has been fixed in version 1.7.78.",

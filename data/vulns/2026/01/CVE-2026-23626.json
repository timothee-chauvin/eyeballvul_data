  "details": "Kimai is a web-based multi-user time-tracking application. Prior to version 2.46.0, Kimai's export functionality uses a Twig sandbox with an overly permissive security policy (`DefaultPolicy`) that allows arbitrary method calls on objects available in the template context. An authenticated user with export permissions can deploy a malicious Twig template that extracts sensitive information including environment variables, all user password hashes, serialized session tokens, and CSRF tokens. Version 2.46.0 patches this issue.",

  "details": "NocoDB is software for building databases as spreadsheets. Prior to version 0.301.0, a blind Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability exists in the `uploadViaURL` functionality due to an unprotected `HEAD` request. While the subsequent file retrieval logic correctly enforces SSRF protections, the initial metadata request executes without validation. This allows limited outbound requests to arbitrary URLs before SSRF controls are applied. Version 0.301.0 contains a patch for the issue.",

  "details": "Chainlit versions prior to 2.9.4 contain an arbitrary file read vulnerability in the /project/element update flow. An authenticated client can send a custom Element with a user-controlled path value, causing the server to copy the referenced file into the attacker\u2019s session. The resulting element identifier (chainlitKey) can then be used to retrieve the file contents via /project/file/<chainlitKey>, allowing disclosure of any file readable by the Chainlit service.",

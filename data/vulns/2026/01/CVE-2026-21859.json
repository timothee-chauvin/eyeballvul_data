Versions 1.28.0 and below have a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in the /proxy endpoint, allowing attackers to make requests to internal network resources. The /proxy endpoint validates http:// and https:// schemes, but it does not block internal IP addresses, enabling attackers to access internal services and APIs.

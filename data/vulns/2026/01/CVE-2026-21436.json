  "details": "eopkg is a Solus package manager implemented in python3. In versions prior to 4.4.0, a malicious package could escape the directory set by `--destdir`. This requires the installation of a package from a malicious or compromised source. Files in such packages would not be installed in the path given by `--destdir`, but on a different location on the host. The issue has been fixed in v4.4.0. Users only installing packages from the Solus repositories are not affected.",

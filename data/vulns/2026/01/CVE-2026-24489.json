  "details": "Gakido is a Python HTTP client focused on browser impersonation and anti-bot evasion. A vulnerability was discovered in Gakido prior to version 0.1.1 that allowed HTTP header injection through CRLF (Carriage Return Line Feed) sequences in user-supplied header values and names. When making HTTP requests with user-controlled header values containing `\\r\\n` (CRLF), `\\n` (LF), or `\\x00` (null byte) characters, an attacker could inject arbitrary HTTP headers into the request. The fix in version 0.1.1 adds a `_sanitize_header()` function that strips `\\r`, `\\n`, and `\\x00` characters from both header names and values before they are included in HTTP requests.",

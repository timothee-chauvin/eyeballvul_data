  "details": "Typebot is an open-source chatbot builder. In versions prior to 3.13.2, client-side script execution in Typebot allows stealing all stored credentials from any user. When a victim previews a malicious typebot by clicking \"Run\", JavaScript executes in their browser and exfiltrates their OpenAI keys, Google Sheets tokens, and SMTP passwords. The `/api/trpc/credentials.getCredentials` endpoint returns plaintext API keys without verifying credential ownership. Version 3.13.2 fixes the issue.",

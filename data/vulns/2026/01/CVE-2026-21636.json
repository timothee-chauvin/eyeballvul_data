  "details": "A flaw in Node.js's permission model allows Unix Domain Socket (UDS) connections to bypass network restrictions when `--permission` is enabled. Even without `--allow-net`, attacker-controlled inputs (such as URLs or socketPath options) can connect to arbitrary local sockets via net, tls, or undici/fetch. This breaks the intended security boundary of the permission model and enables access to privileged local services, potentially leading to privilege escalation, data exposure, or local code execution.\n\n* The issue affects users of the Node.js permission model on version v25.\n\nIn the moment of this vulnerability, network permissions (`--allow-net`) are still in the experimental phase.",

  "details": "Signal K Server is a server application that runs on a central hub in a boat. Prior to version 2.19.0, an unauthenticated attacker can pollute the internal state (`restoreFilePath`) of the server via the `/skServer/validateBackup` endpoint. This allows the attacker to hijack the administrator's \"Restore\" functionality to overwrite critical server configuration files (e.g., `security.json`, `package.json`), leading to account takeover and Remote Code Execution (RCE). Version 2.19.0 patches this vulnerability.",

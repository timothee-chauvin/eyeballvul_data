  "details": "Pterodactyl is a free, open-source game server management panel. Versions 1.11.11 and below do not revoke active SFTP connections when a user is removed from a server instance or has their permissions changes with respect to file access over SFTP. This allows a user that was already connected to SFTP to remain connected and access files even after their permissions are revoked. A user must have been connected to SFTP at the time of their permissions being revoked in order for this vulnerability to be exploited. This issue is fixed in version 1.12.0.",

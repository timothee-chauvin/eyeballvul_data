  "details": "Pepr is a type safe K8s middleware. Prior to 1.0.5 , Pepr defaults to a cluster-admin RBAC configuration and does not explicitly force or enforce least-privilege guidance for module authors. The default behavior exists to make the \u201cgetting started\u201d experience smooth: new users can experiment with Pepr and create resources dynamically without needing to pre-configure RBAC. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.0.5.",

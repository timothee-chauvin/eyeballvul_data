  "details": "5ire is a cross-platform desktop artificial intelligence assistant and model context protocol client. Prior to version 0.15.3, an unsafe option parsing vulnerability in the ECharts Markdown plugin allows any user able to submit ECharts code blocks to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the renderer context. This can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) in environments where privileged APIs (such as Electron\u2019s electron.mcp) are exposed, resulting in full compromise of the host system. Version 0.15.3 patches the issue.",

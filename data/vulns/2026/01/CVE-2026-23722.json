  "details": "WeGIA is a Web Manager for Charitable Institutions. Prior to 3.6.2, a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability was discovered in the WeGIA system, specifically within the html/memorando/insere_despacho.php file. The application fails to properly sanitize or encode user-supplied input via the id_memorando GET parameter before reflecting it into the HTML source (likely inside a <script> block or an attribute). This allows unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary JavaScript or HTML into the context of the user's browser session. This vulnerability is fixed in 3.6.2.",

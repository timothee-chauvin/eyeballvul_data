  "details": "Deserialization of Untrusted Data vulnerability in Apache Karaf Decanter.\n\n\nThe Decanter log socket collector exposes the port 4560, without authentication. If the collector exposes allowed classes property, this configuration can be bypassed.\nIt means that the log socket collector is vulnerable to deserialization of untrusted data, eventually causing DoS.\n\n\nNB: Decanter log socket collector is not installed by default. Users who have not installed Decanter log socket are not impacted by this issue.\n\nThis issue affects Apache Karaf Decanter before 2.12.0.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 2.12.0, which fixes the issue.",

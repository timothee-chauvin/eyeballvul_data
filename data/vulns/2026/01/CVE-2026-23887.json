  "details": "Group-Office is an enterprise customer relationship management and groupware tool. In versions 6.8.148 and below, and 25.0.1 through 25.0.79, the application stores unsanitized filenames in the database, which can lead to Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). Users who interact with these specially crafted file names within the Group-Office application are affected. While the scope is limited to the file-viewing context, it could still be used to interfere with user sessions or perform unintended actions in the browser. This issue is fixed in versions 6.8.149 and 25.0.80.",

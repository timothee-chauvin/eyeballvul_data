  "details": "ChatterMate is a no-code AI chatbot agent framework. In versions 1.0.8 and below, the chatbot accepts and executes malicious HTML/JavaScript payloads when supplied as chat input. Specifically, an <iframe> payload containing a javascript: URI can be processed and executed in the browser context.

  "details": "CryptoLib provides a software-only solution using the CCSDS Space Data Link Security Protocol - Extended Procedures (SDLS-EP) to secure communications between a spacecraft running the core Flight System (cFS) and a ground station. Prior to version 1.4.3, an out-of-bounds heap read vulnerability in cryptography_encrypt() occurs when parsing JSON metadata from KMC server responses. The flawed strtok iteration pattern uses ptr + strlen(ptr) + 1 which reads one byte past allocated buffer boundaries when processing short or malformed metadata strings. This issue has been patched in version 1.4.3.",

  "details": "Dottie provides nested object access and manipulation in JavaScript. Versions 2.0.4 through 2.0.6 contain an incomplete fix for CVE-2023-26132. The prototype pollution guard introduced in commit `7d3aee1` only validates the first segment of a dot-separated path, allowing an attacker to bypass the protection by placing `__proto__` at any position other than the first. Both `dottie.set()` and `dottie.transform()` are affected. Version 2.0.7 contains an updated fix to address the residual vulnerability.",

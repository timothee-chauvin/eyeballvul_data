  "details": "PowerDocu contains a Windows GUI executable to perform technical documentations. Prior to 2.4.0, PowerDocu contains a critical security vulnerability in how it parses JSON files within Flow or App packages. The application blindly trusts the $type property in JSON files, allowing an attacker to instantiate arbitrary .NET objects and execute code. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.4.0.",

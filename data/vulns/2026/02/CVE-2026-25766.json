  "details": "Echo is a Go web framework. In versions 5.0.0 through 5.0.2 on Windows, Echo\u2019s `middleware.Static` using the default filesystem allows path traversal via backslashes, enabling unauthenticated remote file read outside the static root. In `middleware/static.go`, the requested path is unescaped and normalized with `path.Clean` (URL semantics). `path.Clean` does not treat `\\` as a path separator, so `..\\` sequences remain in the cleaned path. The resulting path is then passed to `currentFS.Open(...)`. When the filesystem is left at the default (nil), Echo uses `defaultFS` which calls `os.Open` (`echo.go:792`). On Windows, `os.Open` treats `\\` as a path separator and resolves `..\\`, allowing traversal outside the static root. Version 5.0.3 fixes the issue.",

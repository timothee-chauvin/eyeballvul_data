  "details": "Claude Code is an agentic coding tool. Prior to version 2.0.74, due to a Bash command validation flaw in parsing ZSH clobber syntax, it was possible to bypass directory restrictions and write files outside the current working directory without user permission prompts. Exploiting this required the user to use ZSH and the ability to add untrusted content into a Claude Code context window. This issue has been patched in version 2.0.74.",

  "details": "FileRise is a self-hosted web file manager / WebDAV server. Versions prior to 3.3.0, the application contains an unauthenticated file read vulnerability due to the lack of access control on the /uploads directory. Files uploaded to this directory can be accessed directly by any user who knows or can guess the file path, without requiring authentication. As a result, sensitive data could be exposed, and privacy may be breached. This vulnerability is fixed in 3.3.0.",

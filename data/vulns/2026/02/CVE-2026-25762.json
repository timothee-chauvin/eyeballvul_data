  "details": "AdonisJS is a TypeScript-first web framework. Prior to versions 10.1.3 and 11.0.0-next.9, a denial of service (DoS) vulnerability exists in the multipart file handling logic of @adonisjs/bodyparser. When processing file uploads, the multipart parser may accumulate an unbounded amount of data in memory while attempting to detect file types, potentially leading to excessive memory consumption and process termination. This issue has been patched in versions 10.1.3 and 11.0.0-next.9.",

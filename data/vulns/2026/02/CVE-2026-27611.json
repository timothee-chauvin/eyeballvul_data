  "details": "FileBrowser Quantum is a free, self-hosted, web-based file manager. Prior to versions 1.1.3-stable and 1.2.6-beta, when users share password-protected files, the recipient can completely bypass the password and still download the file. This happens because the API returns a direct download link in the details of the share, which is accessible to anyone with JUST THE SHARE LINK, even without the password. Versions 1.1.3-stable and 1.2.6-beta fix the issue.",

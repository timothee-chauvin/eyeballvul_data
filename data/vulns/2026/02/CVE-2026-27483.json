  "details": "MindsDB is a platform for building artificial intelligence from enterprise data. Prior to version 25.9.1.1, there is a path traversal vulnerability in Mindsdb's /api/files interface, which an authenticated attacker can exploit to achieve remote command execution. The vulnerability exists in the \"Upload File\" module, which corresponds to the API endpoint /api/files. Since the multipart file upload does not perform security checks on the uploaded file path, an attacker can perform path traversal by using `../` sequences in the filename field. The file write operation occurs before calling clear_filename and save_file, meaning there is no filtering of filenames or file types, allowing arbitrary content to be written to any path on the server. Version 25.9.1.1 patches the issue.",

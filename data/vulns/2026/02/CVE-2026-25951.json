  "details": "FUXA is a web-based Process Visualization (SCADA/HMI/Dashboard) software. Prior to 1.2.11, there is a flaw in the path sanitization logic allows an authenticated attacker with administrative privileges to bypass directory traversal protections. By using nested traversal sequences (e.g., ....//), an attacker can write arbitrary files to the server filesystem, including sensitive directories like runtime/scripts. This leads to Remote Code Execution (RCE) when the server reloads the malicious scripts. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.2.11.",

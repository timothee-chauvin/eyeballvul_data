  "details": "Coturn is a free open source implementation of TURN and STUN Server. Coturn is commonly configured to block loopback and internal ranges using \"denied-peer-ip\" and/or default loopback restrictions. CVE-2020-26262 addressed bypasses involving \"0.0.0.0\", \"[::1]\" and \"[::]\", but IPv4-mapped IPv6 is not covered. When sending a \"CreatePermission\" or \"ChannelBind\" request with the \"XOR-PEER-ADDRESS\" value of \"::ffff:127.0.0.1\", a successful response is received, even though \"127.0.0.0/8\" is blocked via \"denied-peer-ip\". The root cause is that, prior to the updated fix implemented in version 4.9.0, three functions in \"src/client/ns_turn_ioaddr.c\" do not check \"IN6_IS_ADDR_V4MAPPED\". \"ioa_addr_is_loopback()\" checks \"127.x.x.x\" (AF_INET) and \"::1\" (AF_INET6), but not \"::ffff:127.0.0.1.\" \"ioa_addr_is_zero()\" checks \"0.0.0.0\" and \"::\", but not \"::ffff:0.0.0.0.\" \"addr_less_eq()\" used by \"ioa_addr_in_range()\" for \"denied-peer-ip\" matching: when the range is AF_INET and the peer is AF_INET6, the comparison returns 0 without extracting the embedded IPv4. Version 4.9.0 contains an updated fix to address the bypass of the fix for CVE-2020-26262.",

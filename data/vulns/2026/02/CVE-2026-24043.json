  "details": "jsPDF is a library to generate PDFs in JavaScript. Prior to 4.1.0, user control of the first argument of the addMetadata function allows users to inject arbitrary XML. If given the possibility to pass unsanitized input to the addMetadata method, a user can inject arbitrary XMP metadata into the generated PDF. If the generated PDF is signed, stored or otherwise processed after, the integrity of the PDF can no longer be guaranteed. The vulnerability has been fixed in jsPDF@4.1.0.",

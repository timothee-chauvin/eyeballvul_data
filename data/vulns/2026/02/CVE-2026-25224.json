  "details": "Fastify is a fast and low overhead web framework, for Node.js. Prior to version 5.7.3, a denial-of-service vulnerability in Fastify\u2019s Web Streams response handling can allow a remote client to exhaust server memory. Applications that return a ReadableStream (or Response with a Web Stream body) via reply.send() are impacted. A slow or non-reading client can trigger unbounded buffering when backpressure is ignored, leading to process crashes or severe degradation. This issue has been patched in version 5.7.3.",

  "details": "Flask-Reuploaded provides file uploads for Flask. A critical path traversal and extension bypass vulnerability in versions prior to 1.5.0 allows remote attackers to achieve arbitrary file write and remote code execution through Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI). Flask-Reuploaded has been patched in version 1.5.0. Some workarounds are available. Do not pass user input to the `name` parameter, use auto-generated filenames only, and implement strict input validation if `name` must be used.",

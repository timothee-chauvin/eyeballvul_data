  "details": "Tiny File Manager through 2.6 contains a server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in the URL upload feature. Due to insufficient validation of user-supplied URLs, an attacker can send crafted requests to localhost by using http://www.127.0.0.1.example.com/ or a similarly constructed domain name. This may lead to unauthorized port scanning or access to internal-only services.",

  "details": "NanaZip is an open source file archive. Starting in version 5.0.1252.0 and prior to versions 6.0.1638.0 and 6.5.1638.0, NanaZip\u2019s `.NET Single File Application` parser has an out-of-bounds read vulnerability in manifest parsing. A crafted bundle can provide a malformed `RelativePathLength` so the parser constructs a `std::string` from memory beyond `HeaderBuffer`, leading to crash and potential in-process memory disclosure. Versions 6.0.1638.0 and 6.5.1638.0 fix the issue.",

  "details": "InvoicePlane is a self-hosted open source application for managing invoices, clients, and payments. A Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability occurs in the upload Login Logo functions of InvoicePlane version 1.7.0. In the Upload Login Logo, the application allows uploading svg files. Although administrator privileges are required to exploit it, this is still considered a critical vulnerability as it can cause actions such as unauthorized modification of application data, creation of persistent backdoors through stored malicious scripts, and full compromise of the application's integrity. Version 1.7.1 patches the issue.",

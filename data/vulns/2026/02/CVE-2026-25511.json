  "details": "Group-Office is an enterprise customer relationship management and groupware tool. Prior to versions 6.8.150, 25.0.82, and 26.0.5, an authenticated user within the System Administrator group can trigger a full SSRF via the WOPI service discovery URL, including access to internal hosts/ports. The SSRF response body can be exfiltrated via the built\u2011in debug system, turning it into a visible SSRF. This also allows full server-side file read. This issue has been patched in versions 6.8.150, 25.0.82, and 26.0.5.",

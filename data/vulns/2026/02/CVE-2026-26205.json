  "details": "opa-envoy-plugun is a plugin to enforce OPA policies with Envoy. Versions prior to 1.13.2-envoy-2 have a vulnerability in how the `input.parsed_path` field is constructed. HTTP request paths are treated as full URIs when parsed; interpreting leading path segments prefixed with double slashes (`//`) as authority components, and therefore dropping them from the parsed path. This creates a path interpretation mismatch between authorization policies and backend servers, enabling attackers to bypass access controls by crafting requests where the authorization filter evaluates a different path than the one ultimately served. Version 1.13.2-envoy-2 fixes the issue.",

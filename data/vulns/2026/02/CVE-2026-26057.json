  "details": "Skill Scanner is a security scanner for AI Agent Skills that detects prompt injection, data exfiltration, and malicious code patterns. A vulnerability in the API Server of Skill Scanner could allow a unauthenticated, remote attacker to interact with the server API and either trigger a denial of service (DoS) condition or upload arbitrary files. This vulnerability is due to an erroneous binding to multiple interfaces. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending API requests to a device exposing the affected API Server. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to consume an excessive amount of resources (memory starvation) or to upload files to arbitrary folders on the affected device. This vulnerability affects Skill-scanner 1.0.1 and earlier releases when the API Server is enabled. The API Server is not enabled by default. Skill-scanner software releases 1.0.2 and later contain the fix for this vulnerability.",

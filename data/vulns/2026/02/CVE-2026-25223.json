  "details": "Fastify is a fast and low overhead web framework, for Node.js. Prior to version 5.7.2, a validation bypass vulnerability exists in Fastify where request body validation schemas specified by Content-Type can be completely circumvented. By appending a tab character (\\t) followed by arbitrary content to the Content-Type header, attackers can bypass body validation while the server still processes the body as the original content type. This issue has been patched in version 5.7.2.",

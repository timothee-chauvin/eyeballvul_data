  "details": "iccDEV provides a set of libraries and tools that allow for the interaction, manipulation, and application of ICC color management profiles. Prior to version 2.3.1.3, there is a vulnerability IccCmm.cpp:5793 when reading through index during ICC profile processing. The malformed ICC profile triggers improper array bounds validation in the color management module, resulting in an out-of-bounds read that can lead to memory disclosure or segmentation fault from accessing memory beyond the array boundary. This issue has been patched in version 2.3.1.3.",

  "details": "ClipBucket v5 is an open source video sharing platform. Prior to 5.5.3 - #40, a Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) race condition vulnerability exists in ClipBucket's avatar and background image upload functionality. The application moves uploaded files to a web-accessible location before validating them, creating a window where an attacker can execute arbitrary PHP code before the file is deleted. The uploaded file was moved to a web-accessible path via move_uploaded_file(), then validated via ValidateImage(). If validation failed, the file was deleted via @unlink(). This vulnerability is fixed in 5.5.3 - #40.",

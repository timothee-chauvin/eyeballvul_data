  "details": "Qwik is a performance focused javascript framework. Prior to version 1.19.0, an Open Redirect vulnerability in Qwik City's default request handler middleware allows a remote attacker to redirect users to arbitrary protocol-relative URLs. Successful exploitation permits attackers to craft convincing phishing links that appear to originate from the trusted domain but redirect the victim to an attacker-controlled site. This issue has been patched in version 1.19.0.",

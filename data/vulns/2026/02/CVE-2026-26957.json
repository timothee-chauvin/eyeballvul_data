  "details": "Libredesk is a self-hosted customer support desk application. Versions prior to 1.0.2-0.20260215211005-727213631ce6 fail to validate destination URLs for webhooks, allowing an attacker posing as an authenticated \"Application Admin\" to force the server to make HTTP requests to arbitrary internal destinations. This could compromise the underlying cloud infrastructure or internal corporate network where the service is hosted. This issue has been fixed in version 1.0.2-0.20260215211005-727213631ce6.",

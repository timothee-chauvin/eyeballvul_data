  "details": "FrankenPHP is a modern application server for PHP. Prior to 1.11.2, FrankenPHP\u2019s CGI path splitting logic improperly handles Unicode characters during case conversion. The logic computes the split index (for finding .php) on a lowercased copy of the request path but applies that byte index to the original path. Because strings.ToLower() in Go can increase the byte length of certain UTF-8 characters (e.g., \u023a expands when lowercased), the computed index may not align with the correct position in the original string. This results in an incorrect SCRIPT_NAME and SCRIPT_FILENAME, potentially causing FrankenPHP to execute a file other than the one intended by the URI. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.11.2.",

  "details": "NetBox is an open-source infrastructure resource modeling and IP address management platform. A reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in versions 2.11.0 through 3.7.x in the ProtectedError handling logic, where object names are included in HTML error messages without proper escaping. This allows user-controlled content to be rendered in the web interface when a delete operation fails due to protected relationships, potentially enabling execution of arbitrary client-side code in the context of a privileged user.",

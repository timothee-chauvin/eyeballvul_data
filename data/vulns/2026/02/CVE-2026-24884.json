  "details": "Compressing is a compressing and uncompressing lib for node. In version 2.0.0 and 1.10.3 and prior, Compressing extracts TAR archives while restoring symbolic links without validating their targets. By embedding symlinks that resolve outside the intended extraction directory, an attacker can cause subsequent file entries to be written to arbitrary locations on the host file system. Depending on the extractor\u2019s handling of existing files, this behavior may allow overwriting sensitive files or creating new files in security-critical locations. This issue has been patched in versions 1.10.4 and 2.0.1.",

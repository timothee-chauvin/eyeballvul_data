  "details": "OpenS100 (the reference implementation S-100 viewer) prior to commit 753cf29 contain a remote code execution vulnerability via an unrestricted Lua interpreter. The Portrayal Engine initializes Lua using luaL_openlibs() without sandboxing or capability restrictions, exposing standard libraries such as 'os' and 'io' to untrusted portrayal catalogues. An attacker can provide a malicious S-100 portrayal catalogue containing Lua scripts that execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the OpenS100 process when a user imports the catalogue and loads a chart.",

  "details": "Vikunja is an open-source self-hosted task management platform. Prior to version 2.0.0, the application allows users to set weak passwords (e.g., 1234, password) without enforcing minimum strength requirements. Additionally, active sessions remain valid after a user changes their password. An attacker who compromises an account (via brute-force or credential stuffing) can maintain persistent access even after the victim resets their password. Version 2.0.0 contains a fix.",

  "details": "Vikunja is a todo-app to organize your life. Prior to 1.1.0, TaskGlanceTooltip.vue temporarily creates a div and sets the innerHtml to the description. Since there is no escaping on either the server or client side, a malicious user can share a project, create a malicious task, and cause an XSS on hover. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.1.0.",

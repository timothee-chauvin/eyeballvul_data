  "details": "jsPDF is a library to generate PDFs in JavaScript. Prior to 4.2.0, user control of the first argument of the `addImage` method results in denial of service. If given the possibility to pass unsanitized image data or URLs to the `addImage` method, a user can provide a harmful GIF file that results in out of memory errors and denial of service. Harmful GIF files have large width and/or height entries in their headers, which lead to excessive memory allocation. Other affected methods are: `html`. The vulnerability has been fixed in jsPDF 4.2.0. As a workaround, sanitize image data or URLs before passing it to the addImage method or one of the other affected methods.",

  "details": "Homarr is an open-source dashboard. Prior to 1.52.0, a public (unauthenticated) tRPC endpoint widget.app.ping accepts an arbitrary url and performs a server-side request to that URL. This allows an unauthenticated attacker to trigger outbound HTTP requests from the Homarr server, enabling SSRF behavior and a reliable port-scanning primitive (open vs closed ports can be inferred from statusCode vs fetch failed and timing). This vulnerability is fixed in 1.52.0.",

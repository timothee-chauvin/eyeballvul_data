  "details": "The CAF demuxer in modules/demux/caf.c in VideoLAN VLC media player 3.0.4 may read memory from an uninitialized pointer when processing magic cookies in CAF files, because a ReadKukiChunk() cast converts a return value to an unsigned int even if that value is negative. This could result in a denial of service and/or a potential infoleak.",

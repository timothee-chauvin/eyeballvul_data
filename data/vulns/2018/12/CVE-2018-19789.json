  "details": "An issue was discovered in Symfony 2.7.x before 2.7.50, 2.8.x before 2.8.49, 3.x before 3.4.20, 4.0.x before 4.0.15, 4.1.x before 4.1.9, and 4.2.x before 4.2.1. When using the scalar type hint `string` in a setter method (e.g. `setName(string $name)`) of a class that's the `data_class` of a form, and when a file upload is submitted to the corresponding field instead of a normal text input, then `UploadedFile::__toString()` is called which will then return and disclose the path of the uploaded file. If combined with a local file inclusion issue in certain circumstances this could escalate it to a Remote Code Execution.",

  "details": "An issue was discovered in CCN-lite 2.0.1. There is a heap-based buffer overflow in mkAddToRelayCacheRequest and in ccnl_populate_cache for an array lacking '\\0' termination when reading a binary CCNx or NDN file. This can result in Heap Corruption. This was addressed by fixing the memory management in mkAddToRelayCacheRequest in ccn-lite-ctrl.c.",

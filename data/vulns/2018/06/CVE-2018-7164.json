  "details": "Node.js versions 9.7.0 and later and 10.x are vulnerable and the severity is MEDIUM. A bug introduced in 9.7.0 increases the memory consumed when reading from the network into JavaScript using the net.Socket object directly as a stream. An attacker could use this cause a denial of service by sending tiny chunks of data in short succession. This vulnerability was restored by reverting to the prior behaviour.",

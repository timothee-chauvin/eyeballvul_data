  "details": "Xfce Thunar 1.6.15, when Xfce 4.12 is used, mishandles the IBus-Unikey input method for file searches within File Manager, leading to an out-of-bounds read and SEGV. This could potentially be exploited by an arbitrary local user who creates files in /tmp before the victim uses this input method.",

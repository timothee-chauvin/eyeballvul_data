  "details": "In Drupal versions 8.4.x versions before 8.4.5 users with permission to post comments are able to view content and comments they do not have access to, and are also able to add comments to this content. This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that the comment system must be enabled and the attacker must have permission to post comments.",

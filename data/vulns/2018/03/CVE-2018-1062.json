  "details": "A vulnerability was discovered in oVirt 4.1.x before 4.1.9, where the combination of Enable Discard and Wipe After Delete flags for VM disks managed by oVirt, could cause a disk to be incompletely zeroed when removed from a VM. If the same storage blocks happen to be later allocated to a new disk attached to another VM, potentially sensitive data could be revealed to privileged users of that VM.",

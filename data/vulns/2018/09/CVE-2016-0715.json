  "details": "Pivotal Cloud Foundry Elastic Runtime version 1.4.0 through 1.4.5, 1.5.0 through 1.5.11 and 1.6.0 through 1.6.11 is vulnerable to a remote information disclosure. It was found that original mitigation configuration instructions provided as part of CVE-2016-0708 were incomplete and could leave PHP Buildpack, Staticfile Buildpack and potentially other custom Buildpack applications vulnerable to remote information disclosure. Affected applications use automated buildpack detection, serve files directly from the root of the application and have a buildpack that matched after the Java Buildpack in the system buildpack priority when Java Buildpack versions 2.0 through 3.4 were present.",

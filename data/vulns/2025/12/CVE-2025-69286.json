  "details": "RAGFlow is an open-source RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) engine. In versions prior to 0.22.0, the use of an insecure key generation algorithm in the API key and beta (assistant/agent share auth) token generation process allows these tokens to be mutually derivable. Specifically, both tokens are generated using the same `URLSafeTimedSerializer` with predictable inputs, enabling an unauthorized user who obtains the shared assistant/agent URL to derive the personal API key. This grants them full control over the assistant/agent owner's account. Version 0.22.0 fixes the issue.",

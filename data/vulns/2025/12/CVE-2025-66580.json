  "details": "Dive is an open-source MCP Host Desktop Application that enables integration with function-calling LLMs. A critical Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in versions prior to 0.11.1 in the Mermaid diagram rendering component. The application allows the execution of arbitrary JavaScript via `javascript:`. An attacker can exploit this to inject a malicious Model Context Protocol (MCP) server configuration, leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the victim's machine when the node is clicked. Version 0.11.1 fixes the issue.",

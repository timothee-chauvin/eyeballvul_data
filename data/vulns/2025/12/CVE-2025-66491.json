  "details": "Traefik is an HTTP reverse proxy and load balancer. Versions 3.5.0 through 3.6.2 have inverted TLS verification logic in the nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-ssl-verify annotation. Setting the annotation to \"on\" (intending to enable backend TLS certificate verification) actually disables verification, allowing man-in-the-middle attacks against HTTPS backends when operators believe they are protected. This issue is fixed in version 3.6.3.",

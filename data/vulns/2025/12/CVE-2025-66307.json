  "details": "This admin plugin for Grav is an HTML user interface that provides a convenient way to configure Grav and easily create and modify pages. Prior to 1.11.0-beta.1, a user enumeration and email disclosure vulnerability exists in Grav. The \"Forgot Password\" functionality at /admin/forgot leaks information about valid usernames and their associated email addresses through distinct server responses. This allows an attacker to enumerate users and disclose sensitive email addresses, which can be leveraged for targeted attacks such as password spraying, phishing, or social engineering. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.11.0-beta.1.",

  "details": "An SSTI (Server-Side Template Injection) vulnerability exists in the get_dunning_letter_text method of Frappe ERPNext through 15.89.0. The function renders attacker-controlled Jinja2 templates (body_text) using frappe.render_template() with a user-supplied context (doc). Although Frappe uses a custom SandboxedEnvironment, several dangerous globals such as frappe.db.sql are still available in the execution context via get_safe_globals(). An authenticated attacker with access to configure Dunning Type and its child table Dunning Letter Text can inject arbitrary Jinja expressions, resulting in server-side code execution within a restricted but still unsafe context. This can leak database information.",

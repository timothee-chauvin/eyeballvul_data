  "details": "A Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) misconfiguration vulnerability exists in Dify v1.9.1 in the /console/api/system-features endpoint. The endpoint implements an overly permissive CORS policy that reflects arbitrary Origin headers and sets Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true, allowing any external domain to make authenticated cross-origin requests. NOTE: the Supplier disputes this, providing the rationale of \"sending requests with credentials does not provide any additional access compared to unauthenticated requests.\"",

  "details": "WBCE CMS is a content management system. Versions 1.6.4 and below use function GenerateRandomPassword() to create passwords using PHP's rand(). rand() is not cryptographically secure, which allows password sequences to be predicted or brute-forced. This can lead to user account compromise or privilege escalation if these passwords are used for new accounts or password resets. The vulnerability is fixed in version 1.6.5.",

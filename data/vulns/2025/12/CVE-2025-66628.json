  "details": "ImageMagick is a software suite to create, edit, compose, or convert bitmap images. In versions 7.1.2-9 and prior, the TIM (PSX TIM) image parser contains a critical integer overflow vulnerability in its ReadTIMImage function (coders/tim.c). The code reads width and height (16-bit values) from the file header and calculates image_size = 2 * width * height without checking for overflow. On 32-bit systems (or where size_t is 32-bit), this calculation can overflow if width and height are large (e.g., 65535), wrapping around to a small value. This results in a small heap allocation via AcquireQuantumMemory and later operations relying on the dimensions can trigger an out of bounds read. This issue is fixed in version 7.1.2-10.",

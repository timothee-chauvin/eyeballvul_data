  "details": "Libredesk is a self-hosted customer support desk. Prior to version 0.8.6-beta, LibreDesk is vulnerable to stored HTML injection in the contact notes feature. When adding notes via POST /api/v1/contacts/{id}/notes, the backend automatically wraps user input in <p> tags. However, by intercepting the request and removing the <p> tag, an attacker can inject arbitrary HTML elements such as forms and images, which are then stored and rendered without proper sanitization. This can lead to phishing, CSRF-style forced actions, and UI redress attacks. This issue has been patched in version 0.8.6-beta.",

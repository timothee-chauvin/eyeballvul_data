  "details": "RustFS is a distributed object storage system built in Rust. In versions prior to 1.0.0-alpha.77, RustFS implements gRPC authentication using a hardcoded static token `\"rustfs rpc\"` that is publicly exposed in the source code repository, hardcoded on both client and server sides, non-configurable with no mechanism for token rotation, and universally valid across all RustFS deployments. Any attacker with network access to the gRPC port can authenticate using this publicly known token and execute privileged operations including data destruction, policy manipulation, and cluster configuration changes. Version 1.0.0-alpha.77 contains a fix for the issue.",

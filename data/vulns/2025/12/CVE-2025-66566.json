  "details": "yawkat LZ4 Java provides LZ4 compression for Java. Insufficient clearing of the output buffer in Java-based decompressor implementations in lz4-java 1.10.0 and earlier allows remote attackers to read previous buffer contents via crafted compressed input. In applications where the output buffer is reused without being cleared, this may lead to disclosure of sensitive data. JNI-based implementations are not affected. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.10.1.",

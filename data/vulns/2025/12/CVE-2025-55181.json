  "details": "Sending an HTTP request/response body with greater than 2^31 bytes triggers an infinite loop in proxygen::coro::HTTPQuicCoroSession which blocks the backing event loop and unconditionally appends data to a std::vector per-loop iteration. This issue leads to unbounded memory growth and eventually causes the process to run out of memory.",

  "details": "Arduino IDE is an integrated development environment. Prior to version 2.3.7, Arduino IDE for macOS is installed with world-writable file permissions on sensitive application components, allowing any local user to replace legitimate files with malicious code. When another user launches the application, the malicious code executes with that user's privileges, enabling privilege escalation and unauthorized access to sensitive data. The fix is included starting from the `2.3.7` release.",

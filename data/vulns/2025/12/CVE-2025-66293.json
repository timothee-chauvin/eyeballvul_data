  "details": "LIBPNG is a reference library for use in applications that read, create, and manipulate PNG (Portable Network Graphics) raster image files. Prior to 1.6.52, an out-of-bounds read vulnerability in libpng's simplified API allows reading up to 1012 bytes beyond the png_sRGB_base[512] array when processing valid palette PNG images with partial transparency and gamma correction. The PNG files that trigger this vulnerability are valid per the PNG specification; the bug is in libpng's internal state management. Upgrade to libpng 1.6.52 or later.",

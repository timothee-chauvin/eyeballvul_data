  "details": "CSLA .NET is a framework designed for the development of reusable, object-oriented business layers for applications. Versions 5.5.4 and below allow the use of WcfProxy. WcfProxy uses the now-obsolete NetDataContractSerializer (NDCS) and is vulnerable to remote code execution during deserialization. This vulnerability is fixed in version 6.0.0. To workaround this issue, remove the WcfProxy in data portal configurations.",

  "details": "Frappe Learning Management System (LMS) is a learning system that helps users structure their content. Prior to 2.41.0, a flaw in the server-side authorization logic allowed authenticated users to perform actions beyond their assigned roles across multiple features. Because the affected endpoints relied on client-side or UI-level checks instead of enforcing permissions on the server, users with low-privileged roles (such as students) could perform operations intended only for instructors or administrators via directly using the API's. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.41.0.",

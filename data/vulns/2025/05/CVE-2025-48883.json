  "details": "Chrome PHP allows users to start playing with chrome/chromium in headless mode from PHP. Prior to version 1.14.0, CSS Selector expressions are not properly encoded, which can lead to XSS (cross-site scripting) vulnerabilities. This is patched in v1.14.0. As a workaround, users can apply encoding manually to their selectors if they are unable to upgrade.",

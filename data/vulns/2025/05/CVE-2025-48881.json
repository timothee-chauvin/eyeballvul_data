  "details": "Valtimo is a platform for Business Process Automation. In versions starting from 11.0.0.RELEASE to 11.3.3.RELEASE and 12.0.0.RELEASE to 12.12.0.RELEASE, all objects for which an object-management configuration exists can be listed, viewed, edited, created or deleted by unauthorised users. If object-urls are exposed via other channels, the contents of these objects can be viewed independent of object-management configurations. This issue has been patched in version 12.13.0.RELEASE.  A workaround for this issue involves overriding the endpoint security as defined in ObjectenApiHttpSecurityConfigurer and ObjectManagementHttpSecurityConfigurer. Depending on the implementation, this could result in loss of functionality.",

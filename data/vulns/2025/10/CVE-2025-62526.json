  "details": "OpenWrt Project is a Linux operating system targeting embedded devices. Prior to version 24.10.4, ubusd contains a heap buffer overflow in the event registration parsing code. This allows an attacker to modify the head and potentially execute arbitrary code in the context of the ubus daemon. The affected code is executed before running the ACL checks, all ubus clients are able to send such messages. In addition to the heap corruption, the crafted subscription also results in a bypass of the listen ACL. This is fixed in OpenWrt 24.10.4. There are no workarounds.",

  "details": "Suricata is a network IDS, IPS and NSM engine developed by the OISF (Open Information Security Foundation) and the Suricata community. Version 8.0.0's usage of the tls.subjectaltname keyword can lead to a segmentation fault when the decoded subjectaltname contains a NULL byte. This issue is fixed in version 8.0.1. To workaround this issue, disable rules using the tls.subjectaltname keyword.",

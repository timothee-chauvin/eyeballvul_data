  "details": "HTTP.jl is an HTTP client and server functionality for the Julia programming language. Prior to version 1.10.19, HTTP.jl did not validate header names/values for illegal characters, allowing CRLF-based header injection and response splitting. This enables HTTP response splitting and header injection, leading to cache poisoning, XSS, session fixation, and more. This issue is fixed in HTTP.jl  `v1.10.19`.",

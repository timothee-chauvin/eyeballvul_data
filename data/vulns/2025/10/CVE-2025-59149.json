  "details": "Suricata is a network IDS, IPS and NSM engine developed by the OISF (Open Information Security Foundation) and the Suricata community. In version 8.0.0, rules using keyword ldap.responses.attribute_type (which is long) with transforms can lead to a stack buffer overflow during Suricata startup or during a rule reload. This issue is fixed in version 8.0.1. To workaround this issue, users can disable rules with ldap.responses.attribute_type and transforms.",

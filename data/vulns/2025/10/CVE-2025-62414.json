  "details": "Bagisto is an open source laravel eCommerce platform. In Bagisto v2.3.7, the \u201cCreate New Customer\u201d feature (in the admin panel) is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). An attacker with access to the admin create-customer form can inject malicious JavaScript payloads into certain input fields. These payloads may later execute in the context of an admin\u2019s browser or another user viewing the customer data, enabling session theft or admin-level actions. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.3.8.",

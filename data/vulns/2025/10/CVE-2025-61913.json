  "details": "Flowise is a drag & drop user interface to build a customized large language model flow. In versions prior to 3.0.8, WriteFileTool and ReadFileTool in Flowise do not restrict file path access, allowing authenticated attackers to exploit this vulnerability to read and write arbitrary files to any path in the file system, potentially leading to remote command execution. Flowise 3.0.8 fixes this vulnerability.",

  "details": "Eidos is an extensible framework for Personal Data Management. Versions 0.21.0 and below contain a one-click remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by embedding a specially crafted eidos: URL on any website, including a malicious one they control. When a victim visits such a site or clicks on the link, the browser triggers the app\u2019s custom URL handler (eidos:), causing the Eidos application to launch and process the URL, leading to remote code execution on the victim\u2019s machine. This issue does not have a fix as of October 3, 2025",

  "details": "Wazuh is a free and open source platform used for threat prevention, detection, and response. Prior to 4.11.0, fim_alert() implementation does not check whether the return value of ctime_r is NULL or not before calling strdup() on it. A compromised agent can cause a crash of analysisd by sending a specially crafted message to the wazuh manager. An attacker who is able to craft and send an agent message to the wazuh manager can cause analysisd to crash and make it unavailable. This vulnerability is fixed in 4.11.0.",

  "details": "VDO.Ninja is a tool that brings remote video feeds into OBS or other studio software via WebRTC. From versions 28.0 to before 28.4, a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists on examples/control.html through the room parameter, which is improperly sanitized before being rendered in the DOM.

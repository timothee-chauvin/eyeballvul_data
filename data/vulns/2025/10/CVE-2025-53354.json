  "details": "NiceGUI is a Python-based UI framework. Versions 2.24.2 and below are at risk for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) when developers render unescaped user input into the DOM using ui.html(). NiceGUI did not enforce HTML or JavaScript sanitization, so applications that directly combine components like ui.input() with ui.html() or  ui.chat_message with HTML content without escaping may allow attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the user\u2019s browser. Applications that do not pass untrusted input into ui.html() are not affected. This issue is fixed in version 3.0.0.",

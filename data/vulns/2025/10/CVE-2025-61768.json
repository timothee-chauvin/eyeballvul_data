  "details": "KUNO CMS is a fully deployable full-stack blog application. In versions prior to 1.3.15, an SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery) vulnerability exists in the Media module of the Kuno CMS administrative panel. A logged-in administrator can upload a specially crafted SVG file containing an external image reference, causing the server to initiate an outgoing connection to an arbitrary external URL. This can lead to information disclosure or internal network probing. Version 1.3.15 contains a fix for the issue.",

The exploit has been disclosed publicly and may be used. The vendor explains: \"Our restriction features are designed as guardrails for LLMs to help them stay closer to what users want, rather than hardened security boundaries. (...) For users where security is a top priority, we continue to recommend using Desktop Commander with Docker, which provides actual isolation. (...) We'll keep this issue open for future consideration if we receive more user demand for improved restrictions.\" This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer.",

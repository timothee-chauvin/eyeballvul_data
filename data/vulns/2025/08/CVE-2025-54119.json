  "details": "ADOdb is a PHP database class library that provides abstractions for performing queries and managing databases. In versions 5.22.9 and below, improper escaping of a query parameter may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL statements when the code using ADOdb connects to a sqlite3 database and calls the metaColumns(), metaForeignKeys() or metaIndexes() methods with a crafted table name. This is fixed in version 5.22.10. To workaround this issue, only pass controlled data to metaColumns(), metaForeignKeys() and metaIndexes() method's $table parameter.",

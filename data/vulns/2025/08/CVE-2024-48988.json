  "details": "SQL Injection vulnerability in Apache StreamPark.\n\nThis issue affects Apache StreamPark: from 2.1.4 before 2.1.6.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 2.1.6, which fixes the issue.\n\n\nThis vulnerability is present only in the distribution package (SpringBoot platform) and does not involve Maven artifacts.\nIt can only be exploited after a user has successfully logged into the platform (implying that the attacker would first need to compromise the login authentication). \nAs a result, the associated risk is considered relatively low.",

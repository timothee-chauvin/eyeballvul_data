  "details": "OnboardLite is the result of the Influx Initiative, our vision for an improved student organization lifecycle at the University of Central Florida. An attacker can craft a link to the trusted application that, when visited, redirects the user to a malicious external site. This enables phishing, credential theft, malware delivery, and trust abuse. Any version with commit hash 6cca19e or later implements jwt signing for the redirect url parameter.",

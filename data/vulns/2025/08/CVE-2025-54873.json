  "details": "RISC Zero is a zero-knowledge verifiable general computing platform based on zk-STARKs and the RISC-V microarchitecture. RISC packages risc0-zkvm versions 2.0.0 through 2.1.0 and risc0-circuit-rv32im and risc0-circuit-rv32im-sys versions 2.0.0 through 2.0.4 contain vulnerabilities where signed integer division allows multiple outputs for certain inputs with only one being valid, and division by zero results are underconstrained. This issue is fixed in risc0-zkvm version 2.2.0 and version 3.0.0 for the  risc0-circuit-rv32im and risc0-circuit-rv32im-sys packages.",

  "details": "Russh is a Rust SSH client & server library. In versions 0.54.0 and below, the channel window adjust message of the SSH protocol is used to track the free space in the receive buffer of the other side of a channel. The current implementation takes the value from the message and adds it to an internal state value. This can result in a integer overflow. If the Rust code is compiled with overflow checks, it will panic. A malicious client can crash a server. This is fixed in version 0.54.1.",

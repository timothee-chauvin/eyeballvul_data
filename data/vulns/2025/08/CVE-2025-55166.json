  "details": "savg-sanitizer is a PHP SVG/XML sanitizer. Prior to version 0.22.0, the sanitization logic in the cleanXlinkHrefs method only searches for lower-case attribute name, which allows to by-pass the isHrefSafeValue check. As a result this allows cross-site scripting or linking to external domains. This issue has been patched in version 0.22.0.",

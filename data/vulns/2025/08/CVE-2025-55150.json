  "details": "Stirling-PDF is a locally hosted web application that performs various operations on PDF files. Prior to version 1.1.0, when using the /api/v1/convert/html/pdf endpoint to convert HTML to PDF, the backend calls a third-party tool to process it and includes a sanitizer for security sanitization which can be bypassed and result in SSRF.

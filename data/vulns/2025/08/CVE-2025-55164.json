  "details": "content-security-policy-parser parses content security policy directives. A prototype pollution vulnerability exists in versions 0.5.0 and earlier, wherein if a policy name is called __proto__, one can override the Object prototype. This issue has been patched in version 0.6.0. A workaround involves disabling prototype method in NodeJS, neutralizing all possible prototype pollution attacks. Provide either --disable-proto=delete (recommended) or --disable-proto=throw as an argument to node to enable this feature.",

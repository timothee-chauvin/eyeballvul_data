  "details": "Cherry Studio is a desktop client that supports for multiple LLM providers. From versions 1.4.8 to 1.5.0, there is a one-click remote code execution vulnerability through the custom URL handling. An attacker can exploit this by hosting a malicious website or embedding a specially crafted URL on any website. If a victim clicks the exploit link in their browser, the app\u2019s custom URL handler is triggered, leading to remote code execution on the victim\u2019s machine. This issue has been patched in version 1.5.1.",

  "details": "Coolify versions prior to v4.0.0-beta.420.7 are vulnerable to a remote code execution vulnerability in the project deployment workflow. The platform allows authenticated users, with low-level member privileges, to inject arbitrary shell commands via the Git Repository field during project creation. By submitting a crafted repository string containing command injection syntax, an attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the underlying host system, resulting in full server compromise.",

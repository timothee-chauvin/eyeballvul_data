  "details": "EspoCRM is a web application with a frontend designed as a single-page application and a REST API backend written in PHP. In versions 9.1.6 and below, if a user loads Espo in the browser with double slashes (e.g https://domain//#Admin) and the webserver does not strip the double slash, it can cause a corrupted Slim router's cache. This will make the instance unusable until there is a completed rebuild. This is fixed in version 9.1.7.",

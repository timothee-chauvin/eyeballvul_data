  "details": "Himmelblau is an interoperability suite for Microsoft Azure Entra ID and Intune. In versions 0.8.0 through 0.9.21 and 1.0.0-beta through 1.1.0, Himmelblau stores the cloud TGT received during logon in the Kerberos credential cache. The created credential cache collection and received credentials are stored as world readable. This is fixed in versions 0.9.22 and 1.2.0. To work around this issue, remove all read access to Himmelblau caches for all users except for owners.",

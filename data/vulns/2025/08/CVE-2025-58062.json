  "details": "LSTM-Kirigaya's openmcp-client is a vscode plugin for mcp developer. Prior to version 0.1.12, when users on a Windows platform connect to an attacker controlled MCP server, attackers could provision a malicious authorization server endpoint to silently achieve an OS command injection attack in the open() invocation, leading to client system compromise. This issue has been patched in version 0.1.12.",

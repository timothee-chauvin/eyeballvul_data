  "details": "A memory corruption vulnerability exists in the BMPv3 Palette Decoding functionality of the SAIL Image Decoding Library v0.9.8. When loading a specially crafted .bmp file, an integer overflow can be made to occur which will cause a heap-based buffer to overflow when reading the palette from the image. These conditions can allow for remote code execution. An attacker will need to convince the library to read a file to trigger this vulnerability.",

  "details": "Netty is an asynchronous, event-driven network application framework. Prior to versions 4.1.124.Final and 4.2.4.Final, Netty is vulnerable to MadeYouReset DDoS. This is a logical vulnerability in the HTTP/2 protocol, that uses malformed HTTP/2 control frames in order to break the max concurrent streams limit - which results in resource exhaustion and distributed denial of service. This issue has been patched in versions 4.1.124.Final and 4.2.4.Final.",

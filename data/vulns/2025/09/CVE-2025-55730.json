  "details": "XWiki Remote Macros provides XWiki rendering macros that are useful when migrating content from Confluence. Starting in version 1.0 and prior to version 1.26.5, missing escaping of the title in the confluence paste code macro allows remote code execution for any user who can edit any page. The classes parameter is used without escaping in XWiki syntax, thus allowing XWiki syntax injection which enables remote code execution. Version 1.26.5 has a fix for the issue.",

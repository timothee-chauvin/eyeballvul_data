  "details": "psPAS PowerShell module does not explicitly enforce TLS 1.2 within the 'Get-PASSAMLResponse' function during the SAML authentication process. An unauthenticated attacker in a 'Man-in-the-Middle' position could manipulate the TLS handshake and downgrade TLS to a deprecated protocol. Fixed in 7.0.209.",

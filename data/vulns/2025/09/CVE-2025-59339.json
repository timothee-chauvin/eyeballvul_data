  "details": "The Bastion provides authentication, authorization, traceability and auditability for SSH accesses. Session-recording ttyrec files, may be handled by the provided osh-encrypt-rsync script that is a helper to rotate, encrypt, sign, copy, and optionally move them to a remote storage periodically, if configured to. When running, the script properly rotates and encrypts the files using the provided GPG key(s), but silently fails to sign them, even if asked to.",

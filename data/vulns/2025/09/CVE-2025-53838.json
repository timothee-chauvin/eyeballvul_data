  "details": "LinkAce is a self-hosted archive to collect website links. A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability was discovered in versions prior to 2.1.9 that allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript, which is then executed in the context of a user's browser when the malicious link is clicked. This is a one-click XSS, meaning the victim only needs to click a crafted link \u2014 no further interaction is required. The application contains a stored XSS vulnerability due to insufficient filtering and escaping of user-supplied data inserted into link attributes. Malicious JavaScript code can be saved in the database along with the link and executed in the user\u2019s browser when clicking the link, leading to arbitrary script execution within the context of the site. Version 2.1.9 fixes the issue.",

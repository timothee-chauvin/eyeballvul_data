  "details": "libsmb2 6.2+ is vulnerable to Buffer Overflow. When processing SMB2 chained PDUs (NextCommand), libsmb2 repeatedly calls smb2_add_iovector() to append to a fixed-size iovec array without checking the upper bound of v->niov (SMB2_MAX_VECTORS=256). An attacker can craft responses with many chained PDUs to overflow v->niov and perform heap out-of-bounds writes, causing memory corruption, crashes, and potentially arbitrary code execution. The SMB2_OPLOCK_BREAK path bypasses message ID validation.",

  "details": "Vite is a frontend tooling framework for JavaScript. Prior to versions 7.1.5, 7.0.7, 6.3.6, and 5.4.20, files starting with the same name with the public directory were served bypassing the `server.fs` settings. Only apps that explicitly expose the Vite dev server to the network (using --host or `server.host` config option), use the public directory feature (enabled by default), and have a symlink in the public directory are affected. Versions 7.1.5, 7.0.7, 6.3.6, and 5.4.20 fix the issue.",

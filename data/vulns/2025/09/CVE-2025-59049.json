  "details": "Mockoon provides way to design and run mock APIs. Prior to version 9.2.0, a mock API configuration for static file serving follows the same approach presented in the documentation page, where the server filename is generated via templating features from user input is vulnerable to Path Traversal and LFI, allowing an attacker to get any file in the mock server filesystem.\nThe issue may be particularly relevant in cloud hosted server instances.

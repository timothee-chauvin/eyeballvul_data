  "details": "Hoverfly is an open source API simulation tool. In versions 1.11.3 and prior, Hoverfly\u2019s admin WebSocket endpoint /api/v2/ws/logs is not protected by the same authentication middleware that guards the REST admin API. Consequently, an unauthenticated remote attacker can stream real-time application logs (information disclosure) and/or gain insight into internal file paths, request/response bodies, and other potentially sensitive data emitted in logs. Version 1.12.0 contains a fix for the issue.",

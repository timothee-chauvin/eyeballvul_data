  "details": "Http4s is a Scala interface for HTTP services. In versions from 1.0.0-M1 to before 1.0.0-M45 and before 0.23.31, http4s is vulnerable to HTTP Request Smuggling due to improper handling of HTTP trailer section. This vulnerability could enable attackers to bypass front-end servers security controls, launch targeted attacks against active users, and poison web caches. A pre-requisite for exploitation involves the web application being deployed behind a reverse-proxy that forwards trailer headers. This issue has been patched in versions 1.0.0-M45 and 0.23.31.",

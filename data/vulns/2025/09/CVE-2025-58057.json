  "details": "Netty is an asynchronous event-driven network application framework for rapid development of maintainable high performance protocol servers & clients. In netty-codec-compression versions 4.1.124.Final and below, and netty-codec versions 4.2.4.Final and below, when supplied with specially crafted input, BrotliDecoder and certain other decompression decoders will allocate a large number of reachable byte buffers, which can lead to denial of service. BrotliDecoder.decompress has no limit in how often it calls pull, decompressing data 64K bytes at a time. The buffers are saved in the output list, and remain reachable until OOM is hit. This is fixed in versions 4.1.125.Final of netty-codec and 4.2.5.Final of netty-codec-compression.",

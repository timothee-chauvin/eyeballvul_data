  "details": "TinyEnv is an environment variable loader for PHP applications. In versions 1.0.1, 1.0.2, 1.0.9, and 1.0.10, TinyEnv did not require the `.env` file to exist when loading environment variables. This could lead to unexpected behavior where the application silently ignores missing configuration, potentially causing insecure defaults or deployment misconfigurations. The issue has been fixed in version 1.0.11. All users should upgrade to 1.0.11 or later. As a workaround, users can manually verify the existence of the `.env` file before initializing TinyEnv.",

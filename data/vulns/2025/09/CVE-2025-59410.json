  "details": "Dragonfly is an open source P2P-based file distribution and image acceleration system. Prior to 2.1.0, the code in the scheduler for downloading a tiny file is hard coded to use the HTTP protocol, rather than HTTPS. This means that an attacker could perform a Man-in-the-Middle attack, changing the network request so that a different piece of data gets downloaded. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.1.0.",

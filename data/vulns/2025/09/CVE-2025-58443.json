  "details": "FOG is a free open-source cloning/imaging/rescue suite/inventory management system. Versions 1.5.10.1673 and below contain an authentication bypass vulnerability.

To address this vulnerability immediately, upgrade to the latest version of either the dev-branch or working-1.6 branch. This will patch the issue for users concerned about immediate exposure.

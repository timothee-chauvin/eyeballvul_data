  "details": "jupyterlab is an extensible environment for interactive and reproducible computing, based on the Jupyter Notebook Architecture. Prior to version 4.4.8, links generated with LaTeX typesetters in Markdown files and Markdown cells in JupyterLab and Jupyter Notebook did not include the noopener attribute. This is deemed to have no impact on the default installations. Theoretically users of third-party LaTeX-rendering extensions could find themselves vulnerable to reverse tabnabbing attacks if links generated by those extensions included target=_blank (no such extensions are known at time of writing) and they were to click on a link generated in LaTeX (typically visibly different from other links). This issue has been patched in version 4.4.8.",

Prior to version 250822, after logging into the StreamVault-system, an attacker can modify certain system parameters, construct malicious commands, execute command injection attacks against the system, and ultimately gain server privileges. Users of all versions of the StreamVault system to date who have not modified their background passwords or use weak passwords are at risk of having their systems taken over via remote command execution.

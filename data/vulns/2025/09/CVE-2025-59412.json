  "details": "CubeCart is an ecommerce software solution. Prior to version 6.5.11, a vulnerability exists in the product reviews feature where user-supplied input is not properly sanitized before being displayed. An attacker can submit HTML tags inside the review description field. Once the administrator approves the review, the injected HTML is rendered on the product page for all visitors. This could be used to redirect users to malicious websites or to display unwanted content. This issue has been patched in version 6.5.11.",

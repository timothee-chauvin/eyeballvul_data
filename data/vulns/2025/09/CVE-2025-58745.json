  "details": "WeGIA is a Web manager for charitable institutions. The fix for CVE-2025-22133 was not enough to remediate the arbitrary file upload vulnerability. The WeGIA only check MIME types for Excel files at endpoint `/html/socio/sistema/controller/controla_xlsx.php`, which can be bypassed by using magic bytes of Excel file in a PHP file. As a result, attacker can upload webshell to the server for remote code execution. Version 3.4.11 contains an updated fix.",

  "details": "XWiki Remote Macros provides XWiki rendering macros that are useful when migrating content from Confluence. Starting in version 1.0 and prior to version 1.26.5, missing escaping of the width parameter in the column macro allows remote code execution for any user who can edit any page or who can access the CKEditor converter. The width parameter is used without escaping in XWiki syntax, thus allowing XWiki syntax injection which enables remote code execution when the macro has been installed by a user with programming right, or it at least allows executing Velocity code as the wiki admin. Version 1.26.5 contains a patch for the issue.",

  "details": "esm.sh is a nobuild content delivery network(CDN) for modern web development. In 136 and earlier, a path-traversal flaw in the handling of the X-Zone-Id HTTP header allows an attacker to cause the application to write files outside the intended storage location. The header value is used to build a filesystem path but is not properly canonicalized or restricted to the application\u2019s storage base directory. As a result, supplying ../ sequences in X-Zone-Id causes files to be written to arbitrary directories.",
  "summary": "esm.sh writes arbitrary files via path traversal in `X-Zone-Id` header",

  "details": "1. A cookie is set using the `secure` keyword for `https://target` \n 2. curl is redirected to or otherwise made to speak with `http://target` (same \n   hostname, but using clear text HTTP) using the same cookie set \n 3. The same cookie name is set - but with just a slash as path (`path=\\\"/\\\",`).\n   Since this site is not secure, the cookie *should* just be ignored.\n4. A bug in the path comparison logic makes curl read outside a heap buffer\n   boundary\n\nThe bug either causes a crash or it potentially makes the comparison come to\nthe wrong conclusion and lets the clear-text site override the contents of the\nsecure cookie, contrary to expectations and depending on the memory contents\nimmediately following the single-byte allocation that holds the path.\n\nThe presumed and correct behavior would be to plainly ignore the second set of\nthe cookie since it was already set as secure on a secure host so overriding\nit on an insecure host should not be okay.",

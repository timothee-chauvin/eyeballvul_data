  "details": "dstack is a software development kit (SDK) to simplify the deployment of arbitrary containerized apps into trusted execution environments. In versions of dstack prior to 0.5.4, a malicious host may provide a crafted LUKS2 data volume to a dstack CVM for use as the `/data` mount. The guest will open the volume and write secret data using a volume key known to the attacker, causing disclosure of Wireguard keys and other secret information. The attacker can also pre-load data on the device, which could potentially compromise guest execution. LUKS2 volume metadata is not authenticated and supports null key-encryption algorithms, allowing an attacker to create a volume such that the volume opens (cryptsetup open) without error using any passphrase or token, records all writes in plaintext (or ciphertext with an attacker-known key), and/or contains arbitrary data chosen by the attacker. Version 0.5.4 of dstack contains a patch that addresses LUKS headers.",

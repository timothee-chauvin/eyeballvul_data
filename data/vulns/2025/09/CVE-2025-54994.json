  "details": "@akoskm/create-mcp-server-stdio is an MCP server starter kit that uses the StdioServerTransport. Prior to version 0.0.13, the MCP Server is written in a way that is vulnerable to command injection vulnerability attacks as part of some of its MCP Server tool definition and implementation. The MCP Server exposes the tool `which-app-on-port` which relies on Node.js child process API `exec` which is an unsafe and vulnerable API if concatenated with untrusted user input. Version 0.0.13 contains a fix for the issue.",

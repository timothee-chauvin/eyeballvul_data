  "details": "drawnix is an all in one open-source whiteboard tool. In drawnix versions through 0.2.1, a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the debug logging functionality. User controlled content is inserted directly into the DOM via innerHTML without sanitization when the global function __drawnix__web__console is invoked, as shown in apps/web/src/app/app.tsx where div.innerHTML = value is executed. This can allow arbitrary JavaScript execution in the context of the application if an attacker can cause untrusted data to be passed to the debug logger (for example via a malicious extension or other injection vector), potentially exposing user data or enabling unauthorized actions. The issue is fixed in version 0.3.0. Updating to 0.3.0 or later is recommended. No known workarounds exist.",

  "details": "A flaw was found in how GLib\u2019s GString manages memory when adding data to strings. If a string is already very large, combining it with more input can cause a hidden overflow in the size calculation. This makes the system think it has enough memory when it doesn\u2019t. As a result, data may be written past the end of the allocated memory, leading to crashes or memory corruption.",

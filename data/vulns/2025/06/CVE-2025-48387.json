  "details": "tar-fs provides filesystem bindings for tar-stream. Versions prior to 3.0.9, 2.1.3, and 1.16.5 have an issue where an extract can write outside the specified dir with a specific tarball. This has been patched in versions 3.0.9, 2.1.3, and 1.16.5. As a workaround, use the ignore option to ignore non files/directories.",

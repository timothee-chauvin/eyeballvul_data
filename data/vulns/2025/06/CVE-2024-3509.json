  "details": "A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the Management Console of multiple WSO2 products due to insufficient input validation in the Rich Text Editor within the registry section.\nTo exploit this vulnerability, a malicious actor must have a valid user account with administrative access to the Management Console. If successful, the actor could inject persistent JavaScript payloads, enabling the theft of user data or execution of unauthorized actions on behalf of other users.\n\nWhile this issue enables persistent client-side script execution, session-related cookies remain protected with the httpOnly flag, preventing session hijacking.",

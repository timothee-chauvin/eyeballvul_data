  "details": "OpenList Frontend is a UI component for OpenList. Prior to version 4.0.0-rc.4, a vulnerability exists in the file preview/browsing feature of the application, where files with a .py extension that contain JavaScript code wrapped in <script> tags may be interpreted and executed as HTML in certain modes. This leads to a stored XSS vulnerability. This issue has been patched in version 4.0.0-rc.4.",

A Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Zimbra Classic UI allows attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript within the user's session, potentially leading to unauthorized access to sensitive information. This issue arises from insufficient sanitization of HTML content, specifically involving crafted tag structures and attribute values that include an @import directive and other script injection vectors. The vulnerability is triggered when a user views a crafted e-mail message in the Classic UI, requiring no additional user interaction.",

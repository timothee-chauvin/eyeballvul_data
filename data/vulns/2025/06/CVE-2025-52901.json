  "details": "File Browser provides a file managing interface within a specified directory and it can be used to upload, delete, preview, rename and edit files. Prior to version 2.33.9, access tokens are used as GET parameters. The JSON Web Token (JWT) which is used as a session identifier will get leaked to anyone having access to the URLs accessed by the user. This will give an attacker full access to a user's account and, in consequence, to all sensitive files the user has access to. This issue has been patched in version 2.33.9.",

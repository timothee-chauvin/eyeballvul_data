  "details": "tRPC allows users to build & consume fully typesafe APIs without schemas or code generation. In versions starting from 11.0.0 to before 11.1.1, an unhandled error is thrown when validating invalid connectionParams which crashes a tRPC WebSocket server. This allows any unauthenticated user to crash a tRPC 11 WebSocket server. Any tRPC 11 server with WebSocket enabled with a createContext method set is vulnerable. This issue has been patched in version 11.1.1.",

  "details": "Miniflux is a feed reader. Due to a weak Content Security Policy on the /proxy/* route, an attacker can bypass the CSP of the media proxy and execute cross-site scripting when opening external images in a new tab/window. To mitigate the vulnerability, the CSP for the media proxy has been changed from default-src 'self' to default-src 'none'; form-action 'none'; sandbox;. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.2.7.",

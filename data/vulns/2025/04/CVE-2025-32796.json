  "details": "Dify is an open-source LLM app development platform. Prior to version 0.6.12, a vulnerability was identified in the DIFY where normal users can enable or disable apps through the API, even though the web UI button for this action is disabled and normal users are not permitted to make such changes. This access control flaw allows non-admin users to make unauthorized changes, which can disrupt the functionality and availability of the APPS. This issue has been patched in version 0.6.12. A workaround for this vulnerability involves updating the API access control mechanisms to enforce stricter user role permissions and implementing role-based access controls (RBAC) to ensure that only users with admin privileges can send enable or disable requests for apps.",

  "details": "Rallly is an open-source scheduling and collaboration tool. Prior to version 4.5.6, an information disclosure vulnerability exposes participant details, including names and email addresses through the /api/trpc/polls.get,polls.participants.list endpoint, even when Pro privacy features are enabled. This bypasses intended privacy controls that should prevent participants from viewing other users\u2019 personal information. This issue has been patched in version 4.5.6.",

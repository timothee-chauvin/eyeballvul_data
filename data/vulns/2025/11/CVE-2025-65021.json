  "details": "Rallly is an open-source scheduling and collaboration tool. Prior to version 4.5.4, an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability exists in the poll finalization feature of the application. Any authenticated user can finalize a poll they do not own by manipulating the pollId parameter in the request. This allows unauthorized users to finalize other users\u2019 polls and convert them into events without proper authorization checks, potentially disrupting user workflows and causing data integrity and availability issues. This issue has been patched in version 4.5.4.",

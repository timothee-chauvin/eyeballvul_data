  "details": "An issue was discovered in 5.1 before 5.1.14, 4.2 before 4.2.26, and 5.2 before 5.2.8.\nNFKC normalization in Python is slow on Windows. As a consequence, `django.http.HttpResponseRedirect`, `django.http.HttpResponsePermanentRedirect`, and the shortcut `django.shortcuts.redirect`  were subject to a potential  denial-of-service attack via certain inputs with a very large number of Unicode characters.\nEarlier, unsupported Django series (such as 5.0.x, 4.1.x, and 3.2.x) were not evaluated and may also be affected.\nDjango would like to thank Seokchan Yoon for reporting this issue.",

  "details": "Bugsink is a self-hosted error tracking tool. In versions prior to 2.0.5, brotli \"bombs\" (highly compressed brotli streams, such as many zeros) can be sent to the server. Since the server will attempt to decompress these streams before applying various maximums, this can lead to exhaustion of the available memory and thus a Denial of Service. This can be done if the `DSN` is known, which it is in many common setups (JavaScript, Mobile Apps). The issue is patched in Bugsink version `2.0.5`. The vulnerability is similar to, but distinct from, another brotli-related problem in Bugsink, GHSA-rrx3-2x4g-mq2h/CVE-2025-64509.",

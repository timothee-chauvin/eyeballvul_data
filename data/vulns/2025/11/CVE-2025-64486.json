  "details": "calibre is an e-book manager. In versions 8.13.0 and prior, calibre does not validate filenames when handling binary assets in FB2 files, allowing an attacker to write arbitrary files on the filesystem when viewing or converting a malicious FictionBook file. This can be leveraged to achieve arbitrary code execution. This issue is fixed in version 8.14.0.",

  "details": "LinkAce is a self-hosted archive to collect website links. In versions 2.3.1 and below, the social media sharing functionality contains a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability that allows any authenticated user to inject arbitrary JavaScript by creating a link with malicious HTML in the title field. When a user views the link details page and the shareable links are rendered, the malicious JavaScript executes in their browser. This vulnerability affects multiple sharing services and can be exploited to steal session cookies, perform actions on behalf of users, or deliver malware. This issue is fixed in version 2.4.0.",

  "details": "Astro is a web framework. Prior to version 5.15.9, when using Astro's Cloudflare adapter (@astrojs/cloudflare) with output: 'server', the image optimization endpoint (/_image) contains a critical vulnerability in the isRemoteAllowed() function that unconditionally allows data: protocol URLs. This enables Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks through malicious SVG payloads, bypassing domain restrictions and Content Security Policy protections. This issue has been patched in version 5.15.9.",

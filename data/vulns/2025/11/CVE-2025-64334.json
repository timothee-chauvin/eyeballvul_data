  "details": "Suricata is a network IDS, IPS and NSM engine developed by the OISF (Open Information Security Foundation) and the Suricata community. In versions from 8.0.0 to before 8.0.2, compressed HTTP data can lead to unbounded memory growth during decompression. This issue has been patched in version 8.0.2. A workaround involves disabling LZMA decompression or limiting response-body-limit size.",

  "details": "Open OnDemand is an open-source HPC portal. Prior to versions 4.0.8 and 3.1.16, users can craft a \"Time of Check to Time of Use\" (TOCTOU) attack when downloading zip files to access files outside of the OOD_ALLOWLIST. This vulnerability impacts sites that use the file browser allowlists in all current versions of OOD. However, files accessed are still protected by the UNIX permissions.

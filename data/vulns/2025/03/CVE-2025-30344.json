  "details": "An issue was discovered in OpenSlides before 4.2.5. During login at the /system/auth/login/ endpoint, the system's response times differ depending on whether a user exists in the system. The timing discrepancy stems from the omitted hashing of the password (e.g., more than 100 milliseconds).",

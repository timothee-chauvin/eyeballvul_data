  "details": "A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in langgenius/dify version latest, specifically in the chat log functionality. The vulnerability arises because certain HTML tags like <input> and <form> are not disallowed, allowing an attacker to inject malicious HTML into the log via prompts. When an admin views the log containing the malicious HTML, the attacker could steal the admin's credentials or sensitive information. This issue is fixed in version 0.12.1.",

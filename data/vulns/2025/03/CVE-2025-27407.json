  "details": "graphql-ruby is a Ruby implementation of GraphQL. Starting in version 1.11.5 and prior to versions 1.11.8, 1.12.25, 1.13.24, 2.0.32, 2.1.14, 2.2.17, and 2.3.21, loading a malicious schema definition in `GraphQL::Schema.from_introspection` (or `GraphQL::Schema::Loader.load`) can result in remote code execution. Any system which loads a schema by JSON from an untrusted source is vulnerable, including those that use GraphQL::Client to load external schemas via GraphQL introspection. Versions 1.11.8, 1.12.25, 1.13.24, 2.0.32, 2.1.14, 2.2.17, and 2.3.21 contain a patch for the issue.",

  "details": "Agate is central authentication server software for OBiBa epidemiology applications. Prior to version 3.3.0, when registering for an Agate account, arbitrary HTML code can be injected into a user's first and last name. This HTML is then rendered in the email sent to administrative users. The Agate service account sends this email and appears trustworthy, making this a significant risk for phishing attacks. Administrative users are impacted, as they can be targeted by unauthenticated users. Version 3.3.0 fixes the issue.",

  "details": "kin-openapi is a Go project for handling OpenAPI files. Prior to 0.131.0, when validating a request with a multipart/form-data schema, if the OpenAPI schema allows it, an attacker can upload a crafted ZIP file (e.g., a ZIP bomb), causing the server to consume all available system memory. The root cause comes from the ZipFileBodyDecoder, which is registered automatically by the module (contrary to what the documentation says). This vulnerability is fixed in 0.131.0.",

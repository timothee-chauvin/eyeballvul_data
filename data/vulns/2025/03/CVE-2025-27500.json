  "details": "OpenZiti is a free and open source project focused on bringing zero trust to any application. An endpoint(/api/upload) on the admin panel can be accessed without any form of authentication. This endpoint accepts an HTTP POST to upload a file which is then stored on the node and is available via URL. This can lead to a stored cross site scripting attack if the file uploaded contains malicious code and is then accessed and executed within the context of the user's browser. This function is no longer necessary as the ziti-console moves from a node server application to a single page application, and has been disabled. The vulnerability is fixed in 3.7.1.",

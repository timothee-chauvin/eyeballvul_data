  "details": "A vulnerability in corydolphin/flask-cors version 4.0.1 allows for inconsistent CORS matching due to the handling of the '+' character in URL paths. The request.path is passed through the unquote_plus function, which converts the '+' character to a space ' '. This behavior leads to incorrect path normalization, causing potential mismatches in CORS configuration. As a result, endpoints may not be matched correctly to their CORS settings, leading to unexpected CORS policy application. This can cause unauthorized cross-origin access or block valid requests, creating security vulnerabilities and usability issues.",

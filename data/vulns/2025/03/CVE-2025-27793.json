  "details": "Vega is a visualization grammar, a declarative format for creating, saving, and sharing interactive visualization designs. In Vega prior to version 5.32.0, corresponding to vega-functions prior to version 5.17.0, users running Vega/Vega-lite JSON definitions could run unexpected JavaScript code when drawing graphs, unless the library was used with the `vega-interpreter`. Vega version 5.32.0 and vega-functions version 5.17.0 fix the issue. As a workaround, use `vega` with expression interpreter.",

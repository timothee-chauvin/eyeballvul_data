  "details": "In version v0.3.8 of open-webui/open-webui, sensitive actions such as deleting and resetting are performed using the GET method. This vulnerability allows an attacker to perform Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks, where an unaware user can unintentionally perform sensitive actions by simply visiting a malicious site or through top-level navigation. The affected endpoints include /rag/api/v1/reset, /rag/api/v1/reset/db, /api/v1/memories/reset, and /rag/api/v1/reset/uploads. This impacts both the availability and integrity of the application.",

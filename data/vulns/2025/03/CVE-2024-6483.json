  "details": "A vulnerability in the `runs/delete-batch` endpoint of aimhubio/aim version 3.19.3 allows for arbitrary file or directory deletion through path traversal. The endpoint does not mitigate path traversal when handling user-specified run-names, which are used to specify log/metadata files for deletion. This can be exploited to delete arbitrary files or directories, potentially causing denial of service or data loss.",

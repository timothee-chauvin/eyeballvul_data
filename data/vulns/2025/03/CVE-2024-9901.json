  "details": "LocalAI version v2.19.4 (af0545834fd565ab56af0b9348550ca9c3cb5349) contains a vulnerability where the delete model API improperly neutralizes input during web page generation, leading to a one-time storage cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. This vulnerability allows an attacker to store a malicious payload that executes when a user accesses the homepage. Additionally, the presence of cross-site request forgery (CSRF) can enable automated malicious requests.",

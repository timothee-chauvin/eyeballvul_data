  "details": "ruby-saml provides security assertion markup language (SAML) single sign-on (SSO) for Ruby. Prior to versions 1.12.4 and 1.18.0, ruby-saml is susceptible to remote Denial of Service (DoS) with compressed SAML responses. ruby-saml uses zlib to decompress SAML responses in case they're compressed. It is possible to bypass the message size check with a compressed assertion since the message size is checked before inflation and not after. This issue may lead to remote Denial of Service (DoS). Versions 1.12.4 and 1.18.0 fix the issue.",

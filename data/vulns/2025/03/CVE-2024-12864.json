  "details": "A Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability was discovered in the file upload feature of netease-youdao/qanything version v2.0.0. The vulnerability is due to improper handling of form-data with a large filename in the file upload request. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a large filename, causing the server to become overwhelmed and unavailable for legitimate users. This attack does not require authentication, making it highly scalable and increasing the risk of exploitation.",

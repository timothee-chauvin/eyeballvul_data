  "details": "Chatwoot is a customer engagement suite. Prior to 3.16.0, conversation and contact filters endpoints did not sanitize the input of query_operator passed from the frontend or the API. This provided any actor who is authenticated, an attack vector to run arbitrary SQL within the filter query by adding a tautological WHERE clause. This issue is patched with v3.16.0.",

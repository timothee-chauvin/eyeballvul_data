  "details": "RediSearch is a Redis module that provides querying, secondary indexing, and full-text search for Redis. An authenticated redis user executing FT.SEARCH or FT.AGGREGATE with a specially crafted LIMIT command argument, or FT.SEARCH with a specially crafted KNN command argument, can trigger an integer overflow, leading to heap overflow and potential remote code execution. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.6.24, 2.8.21, and 2.10.10. Avoid setting value of -1 or large values for configuration parameters MAXSEARCHRESULTS and MAXAGGREGATERESULTS, to avoid exploiting large LIMIT arguments.",

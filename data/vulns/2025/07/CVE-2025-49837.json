  "details": "GPT-SoVITS-WebUI is a voice conversion and text-to-speech webUI. In versions 20250228v3 and prior, there is an unsafe deserialization vulnerability in vr.py AudioPre. The model_choose variable takes user input (e.g. a path to a model) and passes it to the uvr function. In uvr, a new instance of AudioPre class is created with the model_path attribute containing the aforementioned user input (here called locally model_name). Note that in this step the .pth extension is added to the path. In the AudioPre class, the user input, here called model_path, is used to load the model on that path with torch.load, which can lead to unsafe deserialization. At time of publication, no known patched versions are available.",

  "details": "RomM is a self-hosted rom manager and player. Versions prior to 3.10.3 and 4.0.0-beta.3 have an authenticated path traversal vulnerability in the `/api/raw` endpoint. Anyone running the latest version of RomM and has multiple users, even unprivileged users, such as the kiosk user in the official implementation, may be affected.

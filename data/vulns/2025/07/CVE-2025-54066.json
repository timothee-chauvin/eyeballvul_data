  "details": "DiracX-Web is a web application that provides an interface to interact with the DiracX services. Prior to version 0.1.0-a8, an attacker can forge a request that they can pass to redirect an authenticated user to another arbitrary website. In the login page, DiracX-Web has a `redirect` field which is the location where the server will redirect the user. This URI is not verified, and can be an arbitrary URI. Paired with a parameter pollution, an attacker can hide their malicious URI. This could be used for phishing, and extract new data (such as redirecting to a new \"log in\" page, and asking another time credentials). Version 0.1.0-a8 fixes this vulnerability.",

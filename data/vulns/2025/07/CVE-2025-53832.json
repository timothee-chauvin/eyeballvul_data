  "details": "Lara Translate MCP Server is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server for Lara Translate API. Versions 0.0.11 and below contain a command injection vulnerability which exists in the @translated/lara-mcp MCP Server. The vulnerability is caused by the unsanitized use of input parameters within a call to child_process.exec, enabling an attacker to inject arbitrary system commands. Successful exploitation can lead to remote code execution under the server process's privileges. The server constructs and executes shell commands using unvalidated user input directly within command-line strings. This introduces the possibility of shell metacharacter injection (|, >, &&, etc.). This vulnerability is fixed in version 0.0.12.",

  "details": "PCL (Plain Craft Launcher) Community Edition is a Minecraft launcher. In PCL CE versions 2.12.0-beta.5 to 2.12.0-beta.9, the login credentials used during the third-party login process are accidentally recorded in the local log file. Although the log file is not automatically uploaded or shared, if the user manually sends the log file, there is a risk of leakage. This is fixed in version 2.12.0-beta.10.",

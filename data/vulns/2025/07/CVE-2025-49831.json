  "details": "An attacker of Secrets Manager, Self-Hosted installations that route traffic from Secrets Manager to AWS through a misconfigured network device can reroute authentication requests to a malicious server under the attacker\u2019s control. CyberArk believes there to be very few installations where this issue can be actively exploited, though Secrets Manager, Self-Hosted (formerly Conjur Enterprise) prior to versions 13.5.1 and 13.6.1 and Conjur OSS prior to version 1.22.1 may be affected. Conjur OSS version 1.22.1 and Secrets Manager, Self-Hosted versions 13.5.1 and 13.6.1 fix the issue.",

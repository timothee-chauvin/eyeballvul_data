  "details": "Plack-Middleware-Session before version 0.35 for Perl generates session ids insecurely.\n\nThe default session id generator returns a SHA-1 hash seeded with the built-in rand function, the epoch time, and the PID. The PID will come from a small set of numbers, and the epoch time may be guessed, if it is not leaked from the HTTP Date header. The built-in rand function is unsuitable for cryptographic usage.\n\nPredicable session ids could allow an attacker to gain access to systems.",

  "details": "GPT-SoVITS-WebUI is a voice conversion and text-to-speech webUI. In versions 20250228v3 and prior, there is an unsafe deserialization vulnerability in inference_webui.py. The GPT_dropdown variable takes user input and passes it to the change_gpt_weights function. In change_gpt_weights, the user input, here gpt_path is used to load a model with torch.load, leading to unsafe deserialization. At time of publication, no known patched versions are available.",

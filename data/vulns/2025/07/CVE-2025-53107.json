  "details": "@cyanheads/git-mcp-server is an MCP server designed to interact with Git repositories. Prior to version 2.1.5, there is a command injection vulnerability caused by the unsanitized use of input parameters within a call to child_process.exec, enabling an attacker to inject arbitrary system commands. Successful exploitation can lead to remote code execution under the server process's privileges. The server constructs and executes shell commands using unvalidated user input directly within command-line strings. This introduces the possibility of shell metacharacter injection (|, >, &&, etc.). An MCP Client can be instructed to execute additional actions for example via indirect prompt injection when asked to read git logs. This issue has been patched in version 2.1.5.",

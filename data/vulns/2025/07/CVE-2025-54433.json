  "details": "Bugsink is a self-hosted error tracking service. In versions 1.4.2 and below, 1.5.0 through 1.5.4, 1.6.0 through 1.6.3, and 1.7.0 through 1.7.3,  ingestion paths construct file locations directly from untrusted event_id input without validation. A specially crafted event_id can result in paths outside the intended directory, potentially allowing file overwrite or creation in arbitrary locations. Submitting such input requires access to a valid DSN, potentially exposing them. If Bugsink runs in a container, the effect is confined to the container\u2019s filesystem. In non-containerized setups, the overwrite may affect other parts of the system accessible to that user. This is fixed in versions 1.4.3, 1.5.5, 1.6.4 and 1.7.4.",

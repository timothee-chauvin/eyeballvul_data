  "details": "LaRecipe is an application that allows users to create documentation with Markdown inside a Laravel app. Versions prior to 2.8.1 are vulnerable to Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI), which could potentially lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) in vulnerable configurations. Attackers could execute arbitrary commands on the server, access sensitive environment variables, and/or escalate access depending on server configuration. Users are strongly advised to upgrade to version v2.8.1 or later to receive a patch.",

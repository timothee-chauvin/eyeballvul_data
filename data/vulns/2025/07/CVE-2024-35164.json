  "details": "The terminal emulator of Apache Guacamole 1.5.5 and older does not properly validate console codes received from servers via text-based protocols like SSH. If a malicious user has access to a text-based connection, a specially-crafted sequence of console codes could allow arbitrary code to be executed\nwith the privileges of the running guacd process.\n\n\n\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 1.6.0, which fixes this issue.",

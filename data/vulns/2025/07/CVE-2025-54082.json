  "details": "marshmallow-packages/nova-tiptap is a rich text editor for Laravel Nova based on tiptap. Prior to 5.7.0, a vulnerability was discovered in the marshmallow-packages/nova-tiptap Laravel Nova package that allows unauthenticated users to upload arbitrary files to any Laravel disk configured in the application. The vulnerability is due to missing authentication middleware (Nova and Nova.Auth) on the /nova-tiptap/api/file upload endpoint, the lack of validation on uploaded files (no MIME/type or extension restrictions), and the ability for an attacker to choose the disk parameter dynamically. This means an attacker can craft a custom form and send a POST request to /nova-tiptap/api/file, supplying a valid CSRF token, and upload executable or malicious files (e.g., .php, binaries) to public disks such as local, public, or s3. If a publicly accessible storage path is used (e.g. S3 with public access, or Laravel\u2019s public disk), the attacker may gain the ability to execute or distribute arbitrary files \u2014 amounting to a potential Remote Code Execution (RCE) vector in some environments. This vulnerability was fixed in 5.7.0.",

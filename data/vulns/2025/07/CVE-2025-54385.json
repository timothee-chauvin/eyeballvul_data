  "details": "XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. In versions between 17.0.0-rc1 to 17.2.2 and versions 16.10.5 and below, it's possible to execute any SQL query in Oracle by using the function like DBMS_XMLGEN or DBMS_XMLQUERY. The XWiki#searchDocuments APIs pass queries directly to Hibernate without sanitization. Even when these APIs enforce a specific SELECT clause, attackers can still inject malicious code through HQL's native function support in other parts of the query (such as the WHERE clause). This is fixed in versions 16.10.6 and 17.3.0-rc-1.",

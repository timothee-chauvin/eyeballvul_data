  "details": "`jupyterhub-ltiauthenticator` is a JupyterHub authenticator for learning tools interoperability (LTI). LTI13Authenticator that was introduced in `jupyterhub-ltiauthenticator` 1.3.0 wasn't validating JWT signatures. This is believed to allow the LTI13Authenticator to authorize a forged request. Only users that has configured a JupyterHub installation to use the authenticator class `LTI13Authenticator` are affected. `jupyterhub-ltiauthenticator` version 1.4.0 removes LTI13Authenticator to address the issue. No known workarounds are available.",

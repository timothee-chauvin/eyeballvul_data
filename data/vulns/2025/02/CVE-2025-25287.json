  "details": "Lakeus is a simple skin made for MediaWiki. Starting in version 1.0.8 and prior to versions 1.3.1+REL1.39, 1.3.1+REL1.42, and 1.4.0, Lakeus is vulnerable to store cross-site scripting via malicious system messages, though editing the messages requires high privileges. Those with `(editinterface)` rights can edit system messages that are improperly handled in order to send raw HTML. In the case of `lakeus-footermessage`, this will affect all users if the server is configured to link back to this repository. Otherwise, the system messages in themeDesigner.js are only used when the user enables it in their preferences. Versions 1.3.1+REL1.39, 1.3.1+REL1.42, and 1.4.0 contain a patch.",

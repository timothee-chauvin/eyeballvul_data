  "details": "A time-based blind SQL Injection\u00a0vulnerability exists in the ChurchCRM 5.13.0 and prior\u00a0EditEventAttendees.php\u00a0within the EN_tyid\u00a0parameter. The parameter is directly inserted into an SQL query without proper sanitization, allowing attackers to inject malicious SQL commands. Please note that the vulnerability requires Administrator permissions.\u00a0This flaw can potentially allow attackers to delay the response, indicating the presence of an SQL injection vulnerability. While it is a time-based blind injection, it can be exploited to gain insights into the underlying database, and with further exploitation, sensitive data could be retrieved.",

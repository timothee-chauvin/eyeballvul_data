  "details": "Versions of the package spatie/browsershot before 5.0.5 are vulnerable to Improper Input Validation in the setHtml function, invoked by Browsershot::html(), which can be bypassed by omitting the slashes in the file URI (e.g., file:../../../../etc/passwd). This is due to missing validations of the user input that should be blocking file URI schemes (e.g., file:// and file:/) in the HTML content.",

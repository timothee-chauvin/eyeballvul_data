An OS Command Injection vulnerability was discovered in versions prior to 3.2.15 of the WeGIA application, `importar_dump.php` endpoint. This vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code remotely. The command is basically a command to move a temporary file, so a webshell upload is also possible.

  "details": "Querybook is an open source data querying UI. In affected versions user provided data is not escaped in the error field of the auth callback url in `querybook/server/app/auth/oauth_auth.py` and `querybook/server/app/auth/okta_auth.py`. This may allow attackers to perform reflected cross site scripting (XSS) if Content Security Policy (CSP) is not enabled or `unsafe-inline` is allowed. Users are advised to upgrade to the latest, patched version of querybook (version 3.14.2 or greater). Users unable to upgrade may enable CSP and not allow unsafe-inline or manually escape query parameters in a reverse proxy.",

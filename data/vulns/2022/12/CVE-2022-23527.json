  "details": "mod_auth_openidc is an OpenID Certified\u2122 authentication and authorization module for the Apache 2.x HTTP server. Versions prior to 2.4.12.2 are vulnerable to Open Redirect. When providing a logout parameter to the redirect URI, the existing code in oidc_validate_redirect_url() does not properly check for URLs that start with /\\t, leading to an open redirect. This issue has been patched in version 2.4.12.2. Users unable to upgrade can mitigate the issue by configuring mod_auth_openidc to only allow redirection when the destination matches a given regular expression with OIDCRedirectURLsAllowed.",

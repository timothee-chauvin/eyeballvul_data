  "details": "MinIO is a multi-cloud object storage solution. Starting with version RELEASE.2019-09-25T18-25-51Z and ending with version RELEASE.2022-06-02T02-11-04Z, MinIO is vulnerable to an unending go-routine buildup while keeping connections established due to HTTP clients not closing the connections. Public-facing MinIO deployments are most affected. Users should upgrade to RELEASE.2022-06-02T02-11-04Z to receive a patch. One possible workaround is to use a reverse proxy to limit the number of connections being attempted in front of MinIO, and actively rejecting connections from such malicious clients.",

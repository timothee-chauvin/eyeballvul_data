  "details": "Argo Events is an event-driven workflow automation framework for Kubernetes. Prior to version 1.7.1, several `HandleRoute` endpoints make use of the deprecated `ioutil.ReadAll()`. `ioutil.ReadAll()` reads all the data into memory. As such, an attacker who sends a large request to the Argo Events server will be able to crash it and cause denial of service. A patch for this vulnerability has been released in Argo Events version 1.7.1.",
  "summary": "Uses of deprecated API can be used to cause DoS in user-facing endpoints in Argo Events",

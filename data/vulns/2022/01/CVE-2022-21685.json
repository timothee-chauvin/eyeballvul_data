  "details": "Frontier is Substrate's Ethereum compatibility layer. Prior to commit number `8a93fdc6c9f4eb1d2f2a11b7ff1d12d70bf5a664`, a bug in Frontier's MODEXP precompile implementation can cause an integer underflow in certain conditions. This will cause a node crash for debug builds. For release builds (and production WebAssembly binaries), the impact is limited as it can only cause a normal EVM out-of-gas. Users who do not use MODEXP precompile in their runtime are not impacted. A patch is available in pull request #549.",

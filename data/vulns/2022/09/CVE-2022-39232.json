Starting with version 2.9.0.beta5 and prior to version 2.9.0.beta10, an incomplete quote can generate a JavaScript error which will crash the current page in the browser in some cases. Version 2.9.0.beta10 added a fix and tests to ensure incomplete quotes won't break the app. As a workaround, the quote can be fixed via the rails console.",

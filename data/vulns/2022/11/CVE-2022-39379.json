  "details": "Fluentd collects events from various data sources and writes them to files, RDBMS, NoSQL, IaaS, SaaS, Hadoop and so on. A remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in non-default configurations of Fluentd allows unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary code via specially crafted JSON payloads. Fluentd setups are only affected if the environment variable `FLUENT_OJ_OPTION_MODE` is explicitly set to `object`. Please note: The option FLUENT_OJ_OPTION_MODE was introduced in Fluentd version 1.13.2. Earlier versions of Fluentd are not affected by this vulnerability. This issue was patched in version 1.15.3. As a workaround do not use `FLUENT_OJ_OPTION_MODE=object`.",

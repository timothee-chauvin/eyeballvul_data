  "details": "A user is able to enable their own account if it was disabled by an admin while the user still holds a valid session. Moreover, the username is not properly sanitized in the admin user overview. This enables an XSS attack that enables an attacker with a low privilege user to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of an admin's account.",

  "details": "Discourse is an open source platform for community discussion. In stable versions prior to 2.8.3 and beta versions prior 2.9.0.beta4 erroneously expose groups. When a group with restricted visibility has been used to set the permissions of a category, the name of the group is leaked to any user that is able to see the category. To workaround the problem, a site administrator can remove groups with restricted visibility from any category's permissions setting.",

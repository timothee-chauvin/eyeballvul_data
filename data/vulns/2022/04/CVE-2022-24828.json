  "details": "Composer is a dependency manager for the PHP programming language. Integrators using Composer code to call `VcsDriver::getFileContent` can have a code injection vulnerability if the user can control the `$file` or `$identifier` argument. This leads to a vulnerability on packagist.org for example where the composer.json's `readme` field can be used as a vector for injecting parameters into hg/Mercurial via the `$file` argument, or git via the `$identifier` argument if you allow arbitrary data there (Packagist does not, but maybe other integrators do). Composer itself should not be affected by the vulnerability as it does not call `getFileContent` with arbitrary data into `$file`/`$identifier`. To the best of our knowledge this was not abused, and the vulnerability has been patched on packagist.org and Private Packagist within a day of the vulnerability report.",

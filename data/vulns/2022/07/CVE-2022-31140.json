  "details": "Valinor is a PHP library that helps to map any input into a strongly-typed value object structure. Prior to version 0.12.0, Valinor can use `Throwable#getMessage()` when it should not have permission to do so. This is a problem with cases such as an SQL exception showing an SQL snippet, a database connection exception showing database IP address/username/password, or a timeout detail / out of memory detail. Attackers could use this information for potential data exfiltration, denial of service attacks, enumeration attacks, etc. Version 0.12.0 contains a patch for this vulnerability.",

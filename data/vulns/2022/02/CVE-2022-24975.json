  "details": "The --mirror documentation for Git through 2.35.1 does not mention the availability of deleted content, aka the \"GitBleed\" issue. This could present a security risk if information-disclosure auditing processes rely on a clone operation without the --mirror option. Note: This has been disputed by multiple 3rd parties who believe this is an intended feature of the git binary and does not pose a security risk.",

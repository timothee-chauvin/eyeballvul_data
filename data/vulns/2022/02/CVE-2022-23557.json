  "details": "Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. An attacker can craft a TFLite model that would trigger a division by zero in `BiasAndClamp` implementation. There is no check that the `bias_size` is non zero. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.",

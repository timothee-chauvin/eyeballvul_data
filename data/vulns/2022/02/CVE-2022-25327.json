  "details": "The PAM module for fscrypt doesn't adequately validate fscrypt metadata files, allowing users to create malicious metadata files that prevent other users from logging in. A local user can cause a denial of service by creating a fscrypt metadata file that prevents other users from logging into the system. We recommend upgrading to version 0.3.3 or above",

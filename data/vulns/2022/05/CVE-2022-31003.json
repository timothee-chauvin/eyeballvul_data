  "details": "Sofia-SIP is an open-source Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) User-Agent library. Prior to version 1.13.8, when parsing each line of a sdp message, `rest = record + 2` will access the memory behind `\\0` and cause an out-of-bounds write. An attacker can send a message with evil sdp to FreeSWITCH, causing a crash or more serious consequence, such as remote code execution. Version 1.13.8 contains a patch for this issue.",

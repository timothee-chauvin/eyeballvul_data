  "details": "TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. Prior to versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4, the implementation of `tf.histogram_fixed_width` is vulnerable to a crash when the values array contain `Not a Number` (`NaN`) elements. The implementation assumes that all floating point operations are defined and then converts a floating point result to an integer index. If `values` contains `NaN` then the result of the division is still `NaN` and the cast to `int32` would result in a crash. This only occurs on the CPU implementation. Versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4 contain a patch for this issue.",

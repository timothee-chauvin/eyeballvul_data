  "details": "FreeRDP is a free remote desktop protocol library and clients. FreeRDP based clients on unix systems using `/parallel` command line switch might read uninitialized data and send it to the server the client is currently connected to. FreeRDP based server implementations are not affected. Please upgrade to 2.8.1 where this issue is patched. If unable to upgrade, do not use parallel port redirection (`/parallel` command line switch) as a workaround.",

  "details": "A flaw was found in dpdk. This flaw allows a malicious vhost-user master to attach an unexpected number of fds as ancillary data to VHOST_USER_GET_INFLIGHT_FD / VHOST_USER_SET_INFLIGHT_FD messages that are not closed by the vhost-user slave. By sending such messages continuously, the vhost-user master exhausts available fd in the vhost-user slave process, leading to a denial of service.",

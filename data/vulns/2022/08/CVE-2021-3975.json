  "details": "A use-after-free flaw was found in libvirt. The qemuMonitorUnregister() function in qemuProcessHandleMonitorEOF is called using multiple threads without being adequately protected by a monitor lock. This flaw could be triggered by the virConnectGetAllDomainStats API when the guest is shutting down. An unprivileged client with a read-only connection could use this flaw to perform a denial of service attack by causing the libvirt daemon to crash.",

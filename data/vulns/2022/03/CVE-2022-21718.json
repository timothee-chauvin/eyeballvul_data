  "details": "Electron is a framework for writing cross-platform desktop applications using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. A vulnerability in versions prior to `17.0.0-alpha.6`, `16.0.6`, `15.3.5`, `14.2.4`, and `13.6.6` allows renderers to obtain access to a bluetooth device via the web bluetooth API if the app has not configured a custom `select-bluetooth-device` event handler. This has been patched and Electron versions `17.0.0-alpha.6`, `16.0.6`, `15.3.5`, `14.2.4`, and `13.6.6` contain the fix. Code from the GitHub Security Advisory can be added to the app to work around the issue.",

  "details": "Shescape is a shell escape package for JavaScript. An issue in versions 1.4.0 to 1.5.1 allows for exposure of the home directory on Unix systems when using Bash with the `escape` or `escapeAll` functions from the _shescape_ API with the `interpolation` option set to `true`. Other tested shells, Dash and Zsh, are not affected. Depending on how the output of _shescape_ is used, directory traversal may be possible in the application using _shescape_. The issue was patched in version 1.5.1. As a workaround, manually escape all instances of the tilde character (`~`) using `arg.replace(/~/g, \"\\\\~\")`.",

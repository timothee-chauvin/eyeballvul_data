  "details": "A flaw was found in nbdkit due to to improperly caching plaintext state across the STARTTLS encryption boundary. A MitM attacker could use this flaw to inject a plaintext NBD_OPT_STRUCTURED_REPLY before proxying everything else a client sends to the server, potentially leading the client to terminate the NBD session. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.",

  "details": "The DuckDuckGo browser 7.64.4 on iOS allows Address Bar Spoofing due to mishandling of the JavaScript window.open function (used to open a secondary browser window). This could be exploited by tricking users into supplying sensitive information such as credentials, because the address bar would display a legitimate URL, but content would be hosted on the attacker's web site.",
